**Calculate Conditional Probability**

I've got a conditional probability problem involving events A and B. It gives me P(A) as 0.55 and P(A ∩ B) as 0.27. Now I just need to plug those values into the formula P(B|A) = P(A ∩ B) / P(A) to find the solution.


**Verifying the Solution's Accuracy**

My calculation yields approximately 0.4909, and the provided correct answer is 0.49, which seems to suggest a degree of rounding. I am satisfied with this answer. Now, I will review the educational app's other components to ensure accuracy and suggest any improvements.


**Refining Question Assessment**

I'm now zeroing in on the educational appropriateness. Given the app's "Advanced Probability" label and a level 24 placement, the provided question, while mathematically sound, feels too simplistic. The formula's explicit inclusion makes it a straightforward substitution task, better suited for a lower level. I will consider suggesting alternative ways to increase the difficulty.


**Evaluating Question's Design**

Now, I'm analyzing the question's structure for improvement. The explicit formula makes it too straightforward for its presumed level. The distractors are plausible, but the primary focus should shift toward conceptual understanding. I'm exploring ways to slightly increase the question's challenge while maintaining mathematical rigor and clear objectives.


**Reviewing Question and Solution**

Okay, I've fully reviewed the question text, its math, and the distractors. The calculation, 0.27/0.55 = 0.4909, rounds to the provided answer, 0.49. I still see that the explicit formula makes it trivial for the level. However, the question is mathematically sound, and the distractors are reasonably designed.


**Evaluating the Question's Accuracy**

The given probabilities and the calculated value of 0.4909... confirms the question's mathematical correctness; however, a minor concern surfaces regarding the level of precision of the final answer. The question's most concerning aspect is the mismatch of a probability question with the Integration and Series topic label shown.


**Reviewing the Calculated Solution**

After double-checking, my calculation of 0.4909... confirms that rounding to 0.49 is the closest answer provided. Although potentially lacking ideal precision, it's acceptable. The primary issue is the mismatch between the probability question and the "Integration & Series" topic label, which is incorrect.
