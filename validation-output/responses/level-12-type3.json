    "validationText": "VALID\n\n**Analysis:**\n*   **Mathematical Correctness:** The question asks for the remainder when $f(x) = x^2 + 4x + 4$ is divided by $(x - 3)$. Using the Remainder Theorem, we evaluate $f(3)$.\n    $$f(3) = 3^2 + 4(3) + 4 = 9 + 12 + 4 = 25$$\n    The indicated correct answer (25) is accurate.\n*   **Clarity:** The wording is standard and unambiguous.\n*   **Difficulty:** This is a straightforward application of the Remainder Theorem, suitable for a quick 30-60 second check in a high school algebra or IB Math context (Topic: Functions/Polynomials).\n*   **Distractors:**\n    *   **4:** This is the y-intercept ($f(0)$), a common confusion.\n    *   **0:** Suggests the student might think it's a factor.\n    *   **22:** Plausible calculation error (e.g., calculating $3^2$ as $6$ instead of $9 \\rightarrow 6+12+4=22$).",
