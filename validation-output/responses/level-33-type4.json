    "validationText": "VALID\n\n**Assessment:**\nThe question is mathematically correct and aligns perfectly with the IB Math curriculum standards.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n1.  **Curriculum Alignment:** In IB Mathematics, the notation for a normal distribution is defined as $X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$, where the second parameter is the **variance**, not the standard deviation.\n2.  **Correct Answer:** Given a mean ($\\mu$) of 70 and a standard deviation ($\\sigma$) of 15, the variance is $15^2$. Therefore, the notation $N(70, 15^2)$ is the correct representation.\n3.  **Distractors:**\n    *   $N(70, 15)$ is a strong distractor for students who mistakenly think the second parameter is the standard deviation ($\\sigma$) rather than variance ($\\sigma^2$).\n    *   $N(15, 70)$ tests for swapping parameters.\n    *   $B(70, 15)$ tests for confusing Normal and Binomial distribution notations.\n4.  **Clarity:** The wording is precise and the notation used in the options is standard.",
