The marked correct answer is indeed $6$.\n*   **Notation:** The sigma notation is rendered correctly using standard LaTeX.\n*   **Distractors:**\n    *   $4$: Plausible error (perhaps counting terms $1, 2, 3$ and adding $1$, or misinterpreting limits).\n    *   $9$: Plausible error (perhaps summing the upper limit $3$ three times, or squaring the upper limit).\n    *   $40$: Unlikely to be chosen, but clearly incorrect.\n*   **Difficulty:** While the arithmetic is very simple ($1+2+3$), the question tests the student's ability to read and interpret Sigma notation, which fits the \"Sequences & Series\" topic.",
