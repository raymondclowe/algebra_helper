    "validationText": "**Evaluating the Problem**\n\nI'm currently focused on dissecting the math question. It involves complex numbers and De Moivre's Theorem, specifically asking for simplification. The expression's structure is the next area to explore, after I understand the core concepts. I'm starting to get a clear picture of the required approach.\n\n\n**Applying De Moivre's Theorem**\n\nI've simplified the complex number expression using De Moivre's Theorem in exponential form. The process involved identifying the modulus and argument, applying the power, and calculating the result. Now, I'm checking the options, recognizing a slight notational difference, which is mathematically equivalent, so I will move forward with my answer.\n\n\n**Analyzing Answer Options**\n\nI've examined the multiple-choice options, focusing on their moduli and arguments. Each incorrect choice presents a plausible distractor, based on common errors. Option 2, the modulus is incorrect. Option 3, again the modulus is incorrect. Finally, Option 4, the argument is wrong. However, when checking the answer, and compared with each distractor option, my answer is confirmed. I am satisfied with my calculations.\n\n\n**Verifying Question Validity**\n\nI'm now delving into the question's validity, specifically the distractors, and focusing on mathematical correctness. I've noted the common errors the distractors exploit, such as modulus miscalculations and argument manipulation. Although I've noticed a category mismatch in the question's metadata, the core question appears sound and mathematically correct. I'm focusing on the prompt requirements to confirm my evaluation. My assessment is positive overall.\n\n\n**Final Assessment of Results**\n\nI've confirmed the mathematical correctness: the calculations and answer key are all spot on, and the distractors are skillfully crafted. The difficulty seems appropriate for a De Moivre's theorem application. A potential subtlety is the interpretation of \"simplify,\" given the exponential form. While $-27i$ is the result, the question's context favors an exponential format match.\n\n\n**Examining Contextual Integrity**\n\nI'm now grappling with the relationship between the question's content, the prompt's context, and the app's UI. It seems the module (Integration & Series) doesn't align with the Complex Numbers topic, as presented in the prompt. While the question itself is mathematically sound – simplifying $(3e^{i\\pi/2})^3$ to $27e^{i3\\pi/2}$ is valid – the category mismatch raises a concern about the app's user experience. As the math is sound, I think the issue boils down to question *generation*, and not the maths, after all.\n\n\n**Refining Answer Presentation**\n\nI'm now revisiting the notation for the answer. While $-27i$ is arguably simpler, $27e^{i3\\pi/2}$ aligns better with the multiple-choice format and the exponential representation. I've noted the potential for confusion with $i3\\pi/2$ notation, although it's not technically incorrect. I am re-examining the distractors to confirm the reasoning behind each. Ultimately, everything is internally consistent and mathematically correct.\n\n\n**Considering Simplification Nuance**\n\nI'm now contemplating whether $27e^{i3\\pi/2}$ represents the \"simplified\" answer, even though $e^{i3\\pi/2}$ would be more typical. This notation feels more like an intermediate step, which I now find more curious. I am pondering if this nuance warrants a \"not OK\" flag. I wonder how students might interpret it.\n\n\n",
