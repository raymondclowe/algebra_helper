    "validationText": "**ISSUES FOUND**\n\nWhile the mathematics behind the question is correct, there are significant presentation and formatting errors that need to be fixed.\n\n**1. LaTeX Rendering Error (Major Issue)**\nThe instruction text at the top is displaying raw code rather than formatted text.\n- **Current display:** `\\TEXT{FIND REMAINDER WHEN DIVIDED BY } (X - 4)`\n- **The problem:** The command `\\TEXT` is likely not supported by your renderer (standard LaTeX uses `\\text`), or the syntax is broken. Consequently, the code itself is visible to the student, including a stray closing brace `}` after the word \"BY\".\n- **Fix:** Ensure the text is rendered as plain text or use the correct LaTeX command supported by your engine (e.g., `\\text{Find remainder when divided by } (x-4)`).\n\n**2. Variable Case Inconsistency**\n- **The problem:** The function is defined using lowercase $x$ ($f(x) = x^2 + 6x + 9$), but the question asks for division by $(X - 4)$ using an uppercase $X$. In algebra, variables are case-sensitive.\n- **Fix:** Change $(X - 4)$ to $(x - 4)$ to match the function definition.\n\n**Mathematical Verification:**\n- **Correctness:** The math is correct. Using the Remainder Theorem, we evaluate $f(4)$.\n  $$f(4) = 4^2 + 6(4) + 9 = 16 + 24 + 9 = 49$$\n  Alternatively: $f(x) = (x+3)^2$, so $f(4) = (4+3)^2 = 7^2 = 49$.\n- **Answer Key:** The selected answer (49) is correct.\n- **Distractors:** The distractors (0, 9, 45) are plausible. 0 checks if the student confuses it with a factor; 9 is the y-intercept.\n\n**Summary for fix:**\nCorrect the LaTeX formatting in the prompt and ensure the variable $x$ is lowercase throughout.",
