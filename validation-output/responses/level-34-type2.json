    "validationText": "VALID\n\nThe question is mathematically correct and uses standard statistical terminology.\n\n*   **Concept:** The phrase \"differs from\" correctly implies a two-tailed test, meaning the alternative hypothesis is inequality ($\\neq$).\n*   **Notation:** The use of $H_1$ for the alternative hypothesis and $\\mu$ for the population mean is standard in IB Math.\n*   **Options:** The correct answer ($H_1: \\mu \\neq 61$) is accurately identified. The distractors cover common mistakes: one-tailed tests ($<$ or $>$) and confusing the alternative hypothesis with the null hypothesis ($=$).",
