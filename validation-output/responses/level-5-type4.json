    "validationText": "The question has **ISSUES**.\n\n**1. Topic Mismatch:**\nThe topic is listed as **\"Decimals & Percentages\"**, but the question is a basic integer division problem ($72 \\div 9$). There are no decimals or percentages involved in the calculation or the answer. This question does not test the stated topic.\n\n**2. Difficulty Level:**\nThe question is marked as **Level 5**. In the context of an IB Math curriculum (or generally any secondary education app), a simple multiplication table fact ($72 \\div 9$) is elementary level (primary school). It is likely far too easy for a \"Level 5\" classification.\n\n**Suggested Fixes:**\n*   **To fit the topic:** Change the numbers to involve decimals. For example: **$7.2 \\div 0.9$** or **$0.72 \\div 9$**.\n*   **To fit the current question:** Change the topic to \"Basic Arithmetic\" or \"Integers\" and significantly lower the difficulty level (e.g., to Level 1).",
