One quarter of $50$ is $12.5$.\n- **Answer Accuracy:** The selected answer ($12.5$) is the correct value.\n- **Distractors:** The distractors are plausible. For example, $37.5$ is $75\\%$ of $50$, and $7.5$ is $15\\%$ of $50$, which are common related calculations.\n- **Difficulty:** Appropriate for Level 5 (typically middle school level), involving basic percentage operations without a calculator.\n- **Clarity:** The question is concise and unambiguous.",
