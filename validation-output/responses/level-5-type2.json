    "validationText": "**ISSUE DETECTED**\n\n**1. Formatting/Notation Error:**\nThe primary issue is a display error in the multiple-choice options. All percentage values are displaying a backslash before the percent sign (e.g., `80\\%` instead of $80\\%$).\n*   **Explanation:** In LaTeX code, the percent sign `%` is a special character for comments, so it is written as `\\%` to display the symbol. However, the application is displaying the raw source code (the backslash itself) rather than rendering the symbol correctly.\n*   **Impact:** This looks unprofessional and could be confusing to students who don't understand code syntax.\n\n**2. Mathematical Content:**\n*   **Correctness:** The math itself is correct. Converting the decimal $0.8$ to a percentage yields $80\\%$.\n*   **Distractors:** The distractors ($8\\%$, $0.8\\%$, $800\\%$) are appropriate common misconceptions.\n\n**Suggested Fix:**\n*   **If the text is plain text:** Remove the backslashes from the source data (change `80\\%` to `80%`).\n*   **If the text is LaTeX:** Check the rendering engine configuration. It is currently treating the backslash as a literal character to be displayed rather than an escape character.",
