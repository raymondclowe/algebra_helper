**Examining the Query's Structure**

I am now dissecting the provided mathematics problem. I've pinpointed the core topic: expanding expressions. The specific expression is $2(x + 5)$. I see the explicit instruction is "EXPAND." I'm beginning the process of solving it.


**Evaluating the Difficulty Level**

I'm now assessing the difficulty of the question within its educational context. My initial reaction is that it's too easy for a level 9 problem, considering the IB curriculum's standards. My focus now is determining whether "Level 9" represents a grade or an app-specific scale, as that greatly influences my assessment.


**Revisiting the Context**

Considering the IB curriculum, the question's simplicity puzzles me. Level 9, in an IB context, typically denotes a higher level of mathematical understanding. However, the expansion of $2(x+5)$ seems far too basic for MYP or DP standards. I'm now exploring the possibility that "Level 9" refers to an in-app difficulty scale, which offers a more plausible explanation, given the simplicity of the problem.


**Determining the Correct Solution**

I have carefully assessed the problem's solution, confirming that $2x + 10$ is the correct expansion of $2(x + 5)$. I then examined the incorrect options, noting the common errors students might make, such as forgetting to distribute the multiplier or incorrectly applying exponents.


**Addressing the Difficulty Level**

I'm now revisiting the "Level 9" designation. Given the simple nature of expanding $2(x+5)$, the difficulty appears misaligned. If the application uses a 1-10 difficulty scale, this problem is likely a Level 1 or 2, at most. Considering it in a Grade 9 or IB context, the question is fundamental, suitable as a warm-up exercise. I must highlight this discrepancy.


**Addressing the Level Discrepancy**

My analysis continues. I've concluded the math is correct, but the "Level 9" designation is misleading. Given it's "IB Math curriculum aligned," it likely refers to a grade level, making the question too easy for typical Grade 9 material. My next step will be clarifying the impact of this mislabeling to ensure alignment with expected proficiency levels.


**Evaluating the Solution's Suitability**

I've examined the distractors, finding common errors, particularly the failure to fully distribute the multiplier. Reconsidering the difficulty, my thought is that the question itself is mathematically sound. However, the label "Level 9" still seems incongruous. It is more appropriate for lower levels, meaning the label may need recalibration based on the user's level of familiarity.


**Clarifying Level Appropriateness**

I've re-examined the prompt and the problem's context. The question itself is mathematically sound, and the distractors are effective. However, given that this is designed to align with the IB curriculum, I now believe the level designation is highly suspect. The simplicity of expanding $2(x+5)$ seems far too basic for a level 9 problem, suggesting a significant mismatch between the question's content and the indicated difficulty or target audience. I must recommend that this mismatch be addressed.
