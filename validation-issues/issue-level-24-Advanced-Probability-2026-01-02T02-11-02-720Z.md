**Assessing Conditional Probability**

I'm currently focused on the framework for calculating the conditional probability, P(B|A). The core information available involves the probabilities of event A, and the intersection of events A and B. My next step involves formulating the actual calculations. I will then ensure the steps are precise.


**Confirming Solution Accuracy**

I've just finalized the calculation for the conditional probability, arriving at the approximate decimal value. I then meticulously double-checked each step for potential errors in the arithmetic, especially rounding. My confidence is growing.


**Calculating the Result**

I've successfully computed $P(B|A)$ using the formula. The decimal approximation of the simplified fraction, rounded to two decimal places, is 0.47, matching the correct option in the question. Now, I will evaluate the distractors.


**Examining Question and Data**

I'm now carefully reviewing the question's prompt, given information, and the applicable formula for conditional probability. I'm focusing on the accuracy of the values provided and how they are used. The rounding is something that must be checked.


**Examining Metadata Accuracy**

I'm now carefully inspecting the labeling and topic assignments associated with the probability question. The major issue is the contradiction in the user interface. It states "Lvl: 24: Integration & Series" in the top-left corner, when the question content clearly addresses conditional probability. I will highlight this metadata discrepancy as the most significant area for improvement.


**Addressing the Discrepancy**

I've moved on to drafting the specifics of my report, focusing on the glaring mismatch between the question content (conditional probability) and the topic label presented in the user interface ("Integration & Series"). I am writing about the error in the app's display. I'm also including a brief note about the rounding to clarify my assessment.


**Summarizing the Analysis**

I'm now consolidating my observations. I've re-examined the math and confirmed its correctness, with only minor precision considerations. The crucial point remains the discrepancy between the displayed topic ("Integration & Series") and the actual question content (conditional probability). I will finalize my report by clearly highlighting this crucial error in metadata.
