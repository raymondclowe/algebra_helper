In educational assessment, distractors should represent common misconceptions or calculation errors (e.g., multiplying by the exponent instead of squaring, arithmetic slips). A value like 165 is unrelated to the problem and orders of magnitude away from the correct answer (4), suggesting a bug in the random number generation algorithm for distract",
