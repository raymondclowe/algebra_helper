## Notes and Decisions

### Implementation Principles

1. **Quality over quantity:** Better to have fewer well-tested questions than many buggy ones
2. **Maintain core focus:** Algebraic drill and common operations remain primary goal
3. **User feedback:** Prioritize topics users request or struggle with
4. **Test thoroughly:** Use validation tool for all new questions
5. **Document well:** Update coverage docs as questions are added

### Design Decisions

- All questions must work in multiple-choice format
- LaTeX rendering required for mathematical notation
- Distractors should represent common student errors
- Questions should build on existing level progression
- "Why" question variants for conceptual understanding

### Known Constraints

- Text-based format limits graphical questions
- Multiple-choice format may not suit all topics
- Must maintain spaced repetition and adaptive difficulty
- Cannot dramatically increase app complexity
