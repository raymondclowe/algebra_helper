    "explanation": "Row reduction (Gaussian elimination) is the standard systematic method. It transforms the augmented matrix [A|b] into row echelon form, making it easy to solve by back-substitution. This method works for systems of any size and reveals whether there's a unique solution, no solution, or infinite solutions."

    "validationText": "**Evaluating Question's Design**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the educational design elements. The options presented seem incomplete for the question, but I'll focus on the intent behind them. Does cross-multiplication even apply here, and why is the question phrasing so broad? I am also considering how this relates to learning outcomes.\n\n\n**Reviewing the Response's Justification**\n\nI have reviewed the rationale provided for the correct answer, and it is sound. Specifically, the explanation clarifies why Gaussian elimination is the most systematic and standard approach in the context of IB Math and matrix algebra. The assessment also accurately dismisses the other options and their relative inadequacy. I'm satisfied with the question's overall design and the validity of its solution.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nMy focus has shifted. The mismatch between the question's matrix algebra topic and the apparent integration and series level is concerning. I'm now digging into whether this is a simple labeling error or indicates a deeper issue. The question's difficulty seems appropriate if within the intended matrix algebra context. However, the screenshot highlights a potential flaw in the app's structure.\n\n\n**Investigating Categorization Mismatch**\n\nNow, I'm examining the source of the contradiction. The question's content clearly aligns with matrix algebra, yet the app categorizes it under \"Integration & Series.\" I will see if I can find the precise cause for the discrepancy. It could be a simple labeling mistake or something more intricate within the app's structure.\n\n\n**Identifying Categorization Flaws**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the core issue: the app's mislabeling. The screenshot indicates \"Integration & Series\" for a question explicitly about matrix algebra. This blatant mismatch significantly impacts the educational experience. I'll need to determine whether this is a minor metadata error or a systemic problem.\n\n\n**Addressing Metadata Issues**\n\nI'm now focusing on how the app's structural integrity could affect its effectiveness. The question, while mathematically sound, is misplaced within the current level. I am trying to determine the scope of this categorization problem and if it is present throughout the app or a one-off issue.\n\n\n**Identifying the Key Mismatch**\n\nNow, I'm examining how the app presents the material. The question's matrix algebra content clashes with the \"Integration & Series\" categorization. This is a considerable concern. It could be a simple labeling mistake or a more significant structural issue that will need further investigation.\n\n\n**Addressing the Content's Placement**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the question's content and its appropriate level. While the question itself is sound, the \"Integration & Series\" categorization raises significant concerns. This mismatch needs further analysis, as it directly impacts the learning experience. I will determine if this labeling issue is isolated or prevalent.\n\n\n**Identifying Major Mismatch**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the core issue. The primary concern is the incongruity between the question's content, clearly focused on matrix algebra, and its placement under the \"Integration & Series\" category. This misalignment is substantial, potentially misleading the student and disrupting the learning experience. Therefore, a deeper investigation is required.\n\n\n",
