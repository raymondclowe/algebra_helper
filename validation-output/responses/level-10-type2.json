    "explanation": "Find two numbers that multiply to 8 (the constant term) and add to 6 (the coefficient of x). These numbers are 4 and 2: 4 × 2 = 8 and 4 + 2 = 6. Therefore (x+4)(x+2). This can be verified by expanding."

    "validationText": "VALID\n\n**Assessment:**\n- **Mathematical Correctness:** The factorization of $x^2 + 6x + 8$ is indeed $(x+4)(x+2)$. The expansion $(x+4)(x+2) = x^2 + 2x + 4x + 8 = x^2 + 6x + 8$ confirms this.\n- **Distractors:** The distractors are well-chosen:\n  - $(x-4)(x-2)$ tests for sign errors (results in $x^2 - 6x + 8$).\n  - $(x+6)(x+8)$ tests for the common mistake of just using the visible numbers.\n  - $x(x+6)$ tests for incomplete understanding of quadratic structure.\n- **Clarity:** The notation is standard and unambiguous.\n- **Difficulty:** This is a standard introductory problem for factoring monic quadratics with positive coefficients, suitable for the stated topic.",
