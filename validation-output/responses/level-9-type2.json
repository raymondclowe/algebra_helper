    "validationText": "**Analyzing Question Parameters**\n\nI'm currently focused on the parameters of the math question. It's marked as expanding expressions, which is straightforward. The level, indicated as 9, feels unusually advanced for such basic content. I will need to cross-reference with the IB curriculum to ascertain the proper level.\n\n\n**Verifying Question Components**\n\nI've checked the mathematical correctness of the question and the provided options. The correct answer is indeed 3x + 24. I am now examining the potential for common errors that students might make, considering the incorrect options presented. This analysis will help understand the question's effectiveness in testing understanding.\n\n\n**Assessing Difficulty and Context**\n\nI've been examining the difficulty level. While the math itself is straightforward, the \"Level 9\" designation is the source of the uncertainty. The IB curriculum alignment is the key. Is \"Level 9\" a grade level, or a difficulty rating? If it's a difficulty rating, the question is too easy. I need to confirm the app's leveling system.\n\n\n**Examining Difficulty Discrepancies**\n\nI'm now weighing the app's difficulty level against the question's content. The task of expanding expressions should be introductory, but the \"Level 9\" designation is giving me pause. The options given, and the errors they cater to, are basic algebra mistakes, not representative of level 9 difficulty. I'll need to check the app's leveling system.\n\n\n**Reviewing the Level Indicator**\n\nI've been re-examining the \"Level 9\" designation. Considering all possibilities, my conclusion is that it likely refers to a stage or grade level, and probably not difficulty. However, I need more context to verify this assumption. The question itself is mathematically sound, but its placement within the app's leveling system warrants further investigation.\n\n\n**Clarifying Difficulty Assessment**\n\nI'm now revisiting the \"Level 9\" ambiguity, considering different interpretations. Assuming this corresponds to a grade level, it is not particularly advanced. However, if this refers to the difficulty, then the simplicity of the single-bracket expansion is noteworthy. The question seems mathematically sound, but its perceived difficulty contrasts with the task's simplicity. I'll need more info on the app's grading scale.\n\n\n**Concluding Question Assessment**\n\nI've finalized my analysis of the question. The math is sound, and the distractors effectively target common errors. The formatting has a slight spacing inconsistency, but it's otherwise acceptable. My primary concern remains the \"Level 9\" designation. If it signifies a high difficulty, the question is too easy. However, if it refers to a grade or stage, it is valid, though perhaps elementary for that level.\n\n\n**Refining Difficulty Assessment**\n\nI'm now revisiting the \"Level 9\" designation. Given the simple expansion, I'm leaning toward \"Level 9\" indicating grade level or stage, rather than a high degree of difficulty. However, I still need more context to be certain. The formatting issue with the spacing of the plus signs remains a minor aesthetic consideration.\n\n\n",
