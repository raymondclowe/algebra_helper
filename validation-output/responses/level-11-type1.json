    "validationText": "VALID\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Mathematical Correctness:** The quadratic equation $x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0$ factors to $(x-2)(x-3) = 0$. The roots are $x=2$ and $x=3$. The smaller value is indeed 2.\n- **Answer Accuracy:** The option marked as correct ($x=2$) is mathematically correct based on the specific instruction to find the \"smaller value\".\n- **Distractors:**\n  - $x=3$ is the other valid root (tests reading comprehension).\n  - $x=5$ is the sum of the roots ($-b/a$).\n  - $x=-3$ tests for sign errors in factoring.\n  These are all good, plausible distractors.\n- **Difficulty:** Appropriate for a basic check on solving quadratics without a calculator.",
