The marked correct answer is accurate.\n*   **Distractors:**\n    *   **18:** Catches the common error of multiplying base by exponent ($6 \\times 3$).\n    *   **36:** Catches the error of squaring instead of cubing ($6^2$).\n    *   **222:** A plausible magnitude estimate or calculation error.\n*   **Clarity:** The notation and wording are unambiguous.",
