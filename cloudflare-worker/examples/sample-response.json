    "rationale": "These exercises systematically address your three most common error patterns. By practicing these specific types of problems, you'll build automatic responses that prevent these mistakes. The key is repetition - your brain will learn to automatically include the ± symbol, check for division by zero, and correctly handle negative exponents. Each correct answer strengthens the neural pathway for the right habit. With consistent practice, these correct methods will become second nature, and you'll stop losing points on these common errors in your IB exams.",
