    "explanation": "Divide both sides by 6: x < 27/6 = 4. Note that the inequality sign remains unchanged when dividing by a positive number."

    "validationText": "**ISSUE DETECTED**\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe question is mathematically incorrect based on the provided answer choices.\n\n1.  **Mathematical Solution:**\n    To solve $6x < 27$, you divide both sides by 6.\n    $$x < \\frac{27}{6}$$\n    $$x < 4.5$$\n\n2.  **The Problem:**\n    The option marked as correct is **$x < 4$**. This is incorrect because it excludes valid solutions between 4 and 4.5 (e.g., $x = 4.1$ is a valid solution to the original inequality since $6 \\times 4.1 = 24.6 < 27$, but it is not included in the answer $x < 4$).\n\n    It appears the generator used integer division (truncating the decimal) or rounded incorrectly.\n\n**Suggested Fix:**\nYou have two options to fix this:\n1.  **Change the Question:** Change the inequality to **$6x < 24$**. This results in the solution $x < 4$, which matches the current correct answer choice.\n2.  **Change the Answers:** Update the answer choices to reflect the actual solution, e.g., **$x < 4.5$** or **$x < \\frac{9}{2}$**.",
