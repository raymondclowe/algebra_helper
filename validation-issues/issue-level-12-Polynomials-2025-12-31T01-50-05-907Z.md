**Status: ISSUES FOUND**

While the mathematics itself is correct, there are significant issues regarding the difficulty level and notation for the stated context.

**1. Difficulty Level Mismatch (Major Issue)**
*   **The Problem:** The question is labeled **"Level: 12"** within an **IB Math curriculum** context. In standard educational terms, Level 12 corresponds to Grade 12 (final year of high school, IB Diploma Programme).
*   **Why it's wrong:** The content—adding two linear binomials—is **Pre-Algebra or Algebra 1 material** (typically Grades 7-8). An IB Math student at Level 12 would be studying Calculus, Vectors, or Complex Numbers. This question is far too elementary for the stated level.
*   **Fix:** This question should be categorized as **Level 7 or 8** (or "Beginner/Introductory" within the Polynomials topic).

**2. Notation Style (Minor Issue)**
*   **The Problem:** The term $1x$ is explicitly written with a coefficient of 1.
*   **Why it's wrong:** While mathematically valid, standard mathematical convention omits the coefficient 1 (writing $x$ instead of $1x$). Explicitly writing $1x$ is usually reserved for the very first introduction to variables for young students. For a "Level 12" or even high school level question, this looks unprofessional and computer-generated.
*   **Fix:** The generator should simplify coefficients of 1 to just the variable (e.g., write $x + 1$ instead of $1x + 1$).

**Mathematical Verification (For Reference):**
*   **Question:** $(5x + 8) + (1x + 1)$
*   **Solution:** Combine like terms: $(5x + 1x) + (8 + 1) = 6x + 9$
*   **Answer Key:** The selected answer ($6x + 9$) is mathematically correct.
*   **Distractors:** The distractors are plausible for a beginner student making arithmetic errors.
