    "validationText": "**Assessing Question Content**\n\nI'm currently focused on the problem's core elements. The question asks for scalar multiplication of a matrix, as simple as it sounds. I've noted the topic, the question prompt, and the matrix itself. My next step will be to confirm that the question's intended answer aligns with the expected solution.\n\n\n**Solving and Verifying Solutions**\n\nI've successfully solved the scalar multiplication problem, resulting in the matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 20 \\\\ 16 & 12 \\end{pmatrix}$. My attention is now directed towards evaluating the provided answer options. I will check for the correct answer, which matches my calculation, and analyze the other options to understand potential student errors they might represent.\n\n\n**Verifying the Assessment**\n\nThe evaluation of options is now complete. I've confirmed the correct answer and examined the incorrect choices, identifying the likely student errors they represent, such as confusion between scalar multiplication and addition. I'm now focused on the UI elements, which will inform the overall rating.\n\n\n**Identifying Question Contextual Errors**\n\nI've now fully scrutinized the question's suitability. While the mathematical solution is flawless and the distractors are reasonably designed, a significant problem has surfaced. The question is labeled as \"Integration & Series,\" but it's a basic Matrix Algebra question, representing a critical mismatch and likely confusing students. This metadata error is the core issue.\n\n\n**Assessing the Overall Validity**\n\nThe math problem itself is correct, and the distractors are reasonably designed. However, I'm now acutely aware of a significant issue. The problem's context, specifically the topic labeling as \"Integration & Series,\" is misaligned with the actual matrix algebra content. This represents a substantial categorization error.\n\n\n**Deciding the Final Verdict**\n\nI've considered all aspects, including the correct mathematical solution, the plausible distractors, and the critical metadata inconsistency between the question's content and the UI labeling. While the math itself is perfectly valid, the labeling issue is a significant problem. Given the prompt's focus on the question's appropriateness for the stated difficulty, the mismatch necessitates a more nuanced response. I'm now leaning toward noting the math correctness and the labeling problem, but the ultimate designation will be based on the impact of this mismatch on the user experience.\n\n\n**Determining Final Verdict**\n\nI'm now deciding on a final verdict. While the scalar multiplication is correct, and distractors are plausible, the main issue remains the topic mismatch. The prompt highlights the need to determine if the question is \"Appropriate for the stated difficulty level\". Given the context of a mismatch between the UI topic (\"Integration & Series\") and the actual question (Matrix Algebra), I'll indicate an issue.\n\n\n**Deciding the Final Answer**\n\nI've considered all the information and the prompt's focus. The question's math is correct, but there's a definite inconsistency between the problem's actual content (Matrix Algebra) and the app's labeling (\"Integration & Series\"). The level also seems high for the question's difficulty. Given all of this, I'll indicate a \"VALID\" math answer, while emphasizing the UI mismatch in a note.\n\n\n",
