**ISSUE: Multiple Correct Answers**

The question is mathematically ambiguous because there are two equally valid standard substitutions for the integral $\int \sin(x) \cos(x) \, dx$, both of which are presented as options.

**Detailed Explanation:**
1.  **Option A ($u = \sin(x)$)** is valid:
    *   $du = \cos(x) \, dx$
    *   The integral becomes $\int u \, du$.

2.  **Option B ($u = \cos(x)$)** is **ALSO valid**:
    *   $du = -\sin(x) \, dx \implies -du = \sin(x) \, dx$
    *   The integral becomes $\int -u \, du$.

Since both substitutions are standard, efficient, and correct, it is unfair and confusing to list $u = \cos(x)$ as a distractor (incorrect answer). A student selecting this option would be mathematically correct but penalized by the system.

**Suggested Fix:**
Change the distractor **Option B** ($u = \cos(x)$) to a clearly incorrect substitution to remove ambiguity.
*   **Example replacements:** $u = \tan(x)$, $u = x^2$, or $u = \sin(x) + x$.
