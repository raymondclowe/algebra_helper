    "validationText": "VALID\n\n**Reasoning:**\nThe question is mathematically accurate and uses standard statistical terminology.\n- **Logic:** In hypothesis testing, if the $p\\text{-value}$ is less than the significance level ($\\alpha$), the correct conclusion is to reject the null hypothesis ($H_0$).\n- **Calculation:** Here, $0.001 < 0.05$, so \"Reject $H_0$\" is the correct answer.\n- **Distractors:** The distractors are appropriate. \"Fail to reject $H_0$\" is the opposite error. \"Accept $H_0$\" and \"Accept $H_1$\" test the student's knowledge of precise statistical language (we typically \"reject\" or \"fail to reject\" rather than \"accept\").",
