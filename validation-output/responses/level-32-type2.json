    "validationText": "VALID\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Mathematical Correctness:** The differential equation $\\frac{dy}{dx} = 5y$ is a standard first-order linear ODE. Separating variables yields $\\int \\frac{1}{y} dy = \\int 5 dx$, which leads to $\\ln|y| = 5x + C$, and finally $y = Ae^{5x}$. The selected answer is correct.\n- **Distractors:**\n  - $y = A5x$: Incorrectly assumes a linear relationship.\n  - $y = 5e^x$: Incorrectly places the constant 5 as a coefficient rather than in the exponent.\n  - $y = Ae^x$: Misses the coefficient 5 entirely (solution for $y'=y$).\n  These are all plausible errors for students learning this topic.\n- **Level & Timing:** This is a fundamental recognition problem for differential equations, perfectly suitable for an IB Math curriculum and easily solvable within 30-60 seconds without a calculator.\n- **Notation:** The notation is standard and clear.",
