4. −14
5. I don't know
                    (no penalty)

## Gemini 3 Pro Validation Feedback

not OK

The question is mathematically correct, but it is categorized under the wrong topic.

**Issue:**
The topic label in the top-left corner (and provided in the context) is **"Two-Step Equations"**. However, the question asks for the gradient of a perpendicular line, which is a **Coordinate Geometry** or **Linear Functions** concept. Solving this does not involve solving a two-step algebraic equation (e.g., $2x + 4 = 10$).

**Fix:**
Update the topic metadata for this question to **"Coordinate Geometry"**, **"Linear Graphs"**, or **"Gradients"** to match the content.
