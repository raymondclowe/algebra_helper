Topic Mismatch (Major Issue):**\n*   **Current Label:** The topic is listed as **\"Two-Step Equations\"**.\n*   **Actual Content:** The question asks to **\"CONVERT TO PERCENTAGE\"** ($0.9 \\rightarrow 90\\%$).\n*   **Explanation:** This is a basic arithmetic problem involving decimals and percentages. It is **not** an algebra problem and does not involve solving an equation, let alone a two-step equation (e.g., $2x + 4 = 10$). The question is completely miscategorized.\n\n**2. Difficulty Level (Context Issue):**\n*   **Context:** You mentioned this is an \"IB Math curriculum aligned\" tool.\n*   **Level 7:** In an IB context, \"Level 7\" typically refers to the highest grade on a 1-7 scale, implying advanced difficulty. Even if \"Level 7\" refers to \"Grade 7\" (approx. age 12-13), converting a simple decimal like $0.9$ to a percentage is a foundational skill (typically Grade 5/6) and is likely too easy for a dedicated \"Level 7\" practice module, especially one labeled as Algebra.\n\n**3. Mathematical Correctness (Verified):**\n*   The math itself is correct: $0.9 \\times 100\\% = 90\\%$.\n*   The distractors ($0.9\\%$, $900\\%$, $9\\%$) are plausible common errors.\n\n**Suggested Fixes:**\n*   **Option A (Fix Metadata):** Change the Topic label to **\"Number & Algebra: Percentages\"** or **\"Decimals to Percentages\"** and adjust the difficulty level to a lower tier (e.g., Level 4 or 5).\n*   **Option B (",
