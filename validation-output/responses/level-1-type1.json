The highlighted correct answer is correct.\n*   **Difficulty:** Adding two-digit numbers without regrouping (carrying) is suitable for a beginner level.\n*   **Distractors:**\n    *   $25$ and $27$ are good \"off-by-one\" errors.\n    *   $4$ is a plausible error if the student misreads the plus sign as a minus sign ($15 - 11$).",
