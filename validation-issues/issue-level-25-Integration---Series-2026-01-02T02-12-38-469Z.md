**ISSUES FOUND**

**1. Lack of Simplification in the Correct Answer:**
The marked correct answer is $\frac{6x^3}{3} + C$. While this is technically an accurate intermediate step for the indefinite integral of $6x^2$, it is **not in simplest form**.
*   **Mathematical Standard:** In almost all mathematics curricula (including IB), students are expected to simplify fractions and coefficients. The expression $\frac{6}{3}$ should be simplified to $2$.
*   **Student Experience:** A student solving this correctly will arrive at $2x^3 + C$. Not seeing this option might cause confusion, leading them to think they made a mistake, or forcing them to search for an equivalent unsimplified form, which is not a standard assessment practice.

**2. Formatting of Distractor:**
The top-left distractor is written as $12x^1 + C$. While correct notation, it is standard convention to write $x^1$ simply as
