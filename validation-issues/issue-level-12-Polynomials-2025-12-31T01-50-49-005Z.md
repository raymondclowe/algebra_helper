## Gemini 3 Pro Validation Feedback

**ISSUES FOUND**

While the mathematics behind the question is correct, there are significant presentation and formatting errors that need to be fixed.

**1. LaTeX Rendering Error (Major Issue)**
The instruction text at the top is displaying raw code rather than formatted text.
- **Current display:** `\TEXT{FIND REMAINDER WHEN DIVIDED BY } (X - 4)`
- **The problem:** The command `\TEXT` is likely not supported by your renderer (standard LaTeX uses `\text`), or the syntax is broken. Consequently, the code itself is visible to the student, including a stray closing brace `}` after the word "BY".
- **Fix:** Ensure the text is rendered as plain text or use the correct LaTeX command supported by your engine (e.g., `\text{Find remainder when divided by } (x-4)`).

**2. Variable Case Inconsistency**
- **The problem:** The function is defined using lowercase $x$ ($f(x) = x^2 + 6x + 9$), but the question asks for division by $(X - 4)$ using an uppercase $X$. In algebra, variables are case-sensitive.
- **Fix:** Change $(X - 4)$ to $(x - 4)$ to match the function definition.

**Mathematical Verification:**
- **Correctness:** The math is correct. Using the Remainder Theorem, we evaluate $f(4)$.
  $$f(4) = 4^2 + 6(4) + 9 = 16 + 24 + 9 = 49$$
  Alternatively: $f(x) = (x+3)^2$, so $f(4) = (4+3)^2 = 7^2 = 49$.
- **Answer Key:** The selected answer (49) is correct.
- **Distractors:** The distractors (0, 9, 45) are plausible. 0 checks if the student confuses it with a factor; 9 is the y-intercept.

**Summary for fix:**
Correct the LaTeX formatting in the prompt and ensure the variable $x$ is lowercase throughout.
