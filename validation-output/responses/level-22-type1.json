The indicated correct answer ($19.5$) is accurate.\n- **Clarity:** The instruction \"FIND THE MEAN\" and the data set are presented clearly.\n- **Difficulty:** Adding four two-digit numbers and dividing by 4 is appropriate for a \"No Calc\" environment and fits the 30-60 second timeframe.\n- **Distractors:** The distractors ($23$, $24$, $20.5$) are plausible values that a student might guess or arrive at through calculation errors.",
