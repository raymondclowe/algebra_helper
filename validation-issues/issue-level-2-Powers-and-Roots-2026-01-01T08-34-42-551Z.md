**ISSUE FOUND**

While the arithmetic itself is correct ($15 + 9 = 24$), the question is **categorized incorrectly** and does not fit the stated topic.

**Details:**
*   **Topic Mismatch:** The topic is labeled as **"Squares & Roots"** (and "Powers and Roots" in your description), but the question is a simple linear equation involving basic addition ($? + 9 = 24$). There are no exponents, powers, square roots, or radicals involved in the problem or the solution.
*   **Difficulty Level:** For an IB Math curriculum, even at Level 2, a simple subtraction problem ($24 - 9$) is likely too elementary unless it is intended as a very basic warm-up, but the lack of relevance to the topic is the primary failure.

**Suggested Fixes:**
To align with the "Squares & Roots" topic, the question should be modified to involve those concepts. Here are a few examples of how to fix it:

1.  **Involve a Square Root:**
    *   Question: $\sqrt{?} + 9 = 14$
    *   Solution: $\sqrt{?} = 5 \rightarrow ? = 25$
2.  **Involve a Square:**
    *   Question: $?^2 + 9 = 25$
    *   Solution: $?^2 = 16 \rightarrow ? = 4$ (assuming positive root for this level)
3.  **Involve Powers:**
    *   Question: $2^? + 9 = 25$
    *   Solution: $2^? = 16 \rightarrow ? = 4$

If the intention was to test basic algebra, the topic label needs to be changed to "Basic Algebra" or "Linear Equations".
