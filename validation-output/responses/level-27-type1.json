    "validationText": "**Examining Question Design**\n\nI'm currently focused on the prompt's initial request: analyzing the user's math question. My breakdown so far involves noting the core topic (Proof by Contradiction, targeting the irrationality of $\\sqrt{3}$) and the starting point provided in the question's text. This groundwork will allow a structured evaluation of its effectiveness.\n\n\n**Refining the Evaluation**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the nuances of the options presented, focusing on their correctness relative to the question's premise. The app's logic is vital: while $3 = \\frac{p^2}{q^2}$ is a true statement, $3q^2 = p^2$ is the target, as it immediately reveals the critical divisibility characteristic pivotal for proof by contradiction. The \"best\" answer in this case is context-dependent.\n\n\n**Clarifying Question Intent**\n\nThe analysis continues, with careful examination of the options and their derivation. It's become clearer that option 2 is *technically* correct based only on the instruction (\"square both sides\"). However, the question's hidden goal – guiding the student toward the core logic of the proof (divisibility) – favors option 3. I'm now assessing how well the question wording serves this pedagogical aim.\n\n\n**Assessing Answer Ambiguity**\n\nThe core issue: the question's ambiguity. I now see the direct result of \"squaring both sides\" *is* present as an option, which makes the correct answer uncertain. Option 2 is a valid result but doesn't immediately serve the proof's purpose, while option 3 does. The design flaw: multiple correct answers, making it less a test of understanding and more a test of literal instruction following.\n\n\n**Identifying Question Weakness**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the question's core issue: its potential for student confusion. Focusing on the immediate outcome of \"squaring both sides,\" I see the ambiguity created by offering both the direct result and the rearranged form as viable options. This design undermines the question's effectiveness as an assessment tool.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Flaw**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the crucial point: the question's design inadvertently allows for multiple correct answers. Squaring both sides yields $3 = \\frac{p^2}{q^2}$, yet the intended answer for the proof is $3q^2 = p^2$. This ambiguity undermines the question's effectiveness.\n\n\n**Evaluating the Ambiguity**\n\nI'm now fully focused on the core issue: the question's ambiguity stemming from multiple valid answers. While the rearranged form ($3q^2 = p^2$) is the intended outcome for the proof, the direct result of squaring ($3 = \\frac{p^2}{q^2}$) is also correct. The question's current wording presents this flaw, creating confusion.\n\n\n**Synthesizing the Core Issue**\n\nI'm now focusing on the prompt's main flaw: ambiguity. Both $3 = \\frac{p^2}{q^2}$ and $3q^2 = p^2$ are mathematically correct outcomes, yet the question only marks the latter as the \"correct\" answer. This creates a situation that undermines the question's effectiveness as it can lead to confusion.\n\n\n",
