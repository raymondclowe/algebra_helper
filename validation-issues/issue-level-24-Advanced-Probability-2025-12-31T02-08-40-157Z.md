**ISSUES FOUND**

While the mathematical logic for the correct answer is sound, there is a significant technical/presentation error in the distractors.

**1. Floating Point Display Error (Major Issue):**
The distractor `0.8999999999999999` is a bug.
- **Explanation:** This value is clearly intended to be `0.9` (derived from the common student mistake of adding probabilities: $0.6 + 0.3 = 0.9$). The app is displaying the raw result of a floating-point calculation (standard IEEE 754 precision error) instead of a formatted number.
- **Fix:** The answer generation code must round or format numbers to a specific number of decimal places (e.g., 2 decimal places) before displaying them. The option should simply read `0.9`.

**2. Difficulty Level Mismatch (Minor Issue):**
- **Observation:** The question is labeled "Level: 24" and "Advanced Probability".
- **Critique:** Applying the basic definition of independence ($P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B)$) is a fundamental, introductory concept, not "Advanced". "Advanced" usually implies conditional probability, Bayes' theorem, or complex combinatorics.
- **Suggestion:** Verify if this difficulty rating aligns with the rest of the curriculum.

**Mathematical Verification:**
- **Correct Answer:** The logic is correct. For independent events, $P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A) \times P(B) = 0.6 \times 0.3 = 0.18$. The correct option provided is valid
