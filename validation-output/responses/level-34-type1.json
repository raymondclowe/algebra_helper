    "validationText": "VALID\n\nThe question is mathematically accurate and clearly worded.\n\n*   **Correctness:** The scenario describes a fixed number of independent trials ($n=5$) with two possible outcomes and a constant probability of success ($p=0.5$). This is the definition of a Binomial distribution, denoted as $B(n, p)$.\n*   **Answer:** The selected answer \"Binomial: $B(5, 0.5)$\" is correct.\n*   **Distractors:** The distractors (Poisson, Uniform, Normal) are distinct and incorrect for this specific discrete scenario, making them appropriate choices for a multiple-choice question.\n*   **Notation:** The notation used is standard for IB Mathematics.",
