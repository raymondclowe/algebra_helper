## 📖 Educational Philosophy

Algebra Helper is built on research-backed pedagogical principles designed for student self-help. For a comprehensive review of the learning science foundation, see [PEDAGOGY.md](PEDAGOGY.md).

### Key Learning Principles

#### **Worked Examples & Practice (Cognitive Load Theory)**
Learn by working through specific examples with immediate practice. Research shows worked examples are effective for novice learners by reducing cognitive load (Sweller & Cooper, 1985), especially when combined with self-explanation prompts (Chi et al., 1989).

**Current Implementation:** Multiple-choice practice with explanations on errors. "Why" questions every few problems promote conceptual understanding.

#### **Immediate Feedback**
The tool provides instant verification and explanations. Research on feedback shows that immediate feedback prevents error consolidation and maintains engagement (Hattie & Timperley, 2007). Elaborative feedback addressing misconceptions is more effective than simple verification.

**Current Implementation:** Immediate right/wrong indication with brief explanatory feedback on errors.

#### **Adaptive Difficulty (Zone of Proximal Development)**
Based on Vygotsky's theory, learning is optimal when tasks are challenging but achievable. The app uses a binary search algorithm to calibrate initial difficulty, then dynamically adjusts based on performance to keep you in the productive learning zone.

**Current Implementation:** Adaptive difficulty with "I don't know" option to prevent frustration. Future versions will track skills separately and provide scaffolding beyond just difficulty adjustment.

#### **Constructive Feedback**
Effective feedback addresses three questions (Hattie & Timperley, 2007): Where am I going? (goals), How am I doing? (progress), and Where to next? (improvement strategies).

**Current Implementation:** Brief explanations showing correct method. Enhanced versions will include common misconception addressing and conceptual reasoning.

#### **Motivation & Engagement**
Progress indicators and level advancement provide clear goals and achievement markers. Research on gamification shows it can increase engagement when designed thoughtfully (Deci & Ryan, 1985; Hanus & Fox, 2015).

**Design Choice:** Balanced approach with mastery-oriented progression and "I don't know" option to reduce performance pressure.

#### **Evidence-Based Practices in Development**
- **Spaced Repetition:** Revisiting concepts over time improves retention (Cepeda et al., 2006)
- **Interleaved Practice:** Mixing problem types enhances learning (Rohrer & Taylor, 2007)
- **Metacognitive Strategies:** Self-monitoring and reflection improve understanding (Schraw & Dennison, 1994)

### Appropriate Use & Limitations

**✅ This Tool is Effective For:**
- Procedural fluency practice
- Self-directed skill reinforcement
- Self-assessment
- Independent practice at your own pace
- Building confidence through adaptive difficulty

**⚠️ This Tool Does Not Replace:**
- Formal instruction and structured learning
- Collaborative problem-solving with peers
- Deep conceptual exploration
- Real-world application projects
- Mathematical reasoning and communication practice

**📊 Effectiveness:** We are committed to evidence-based practice and continuous improvement. See [PEDAGOGY.md](PEDAGOGY.md) for our validation framework and research methodology.

### Tips for Effective Use

**📊 Self-Assessment**
- Use the calibration phase to understand where you are in your algebra journey
- Monitor the "Last 5 Avg" accuracy to track your progress

**🏠 Independent Practice**
- Practice 15-20 minutes daily for best results
- Work at your own pace without pressure

**👥 Study with Friends**
- Work through problems together with study partners
- Discuss wrong answers to deepen understanding

**🎯 Focus on Weak Areas**
- If struggling with specific concepts, use the calibration to adjust your level
- The adaptive system ensures you're not overwhelmed

**⏱️ Regular Practice**
- Quick 5-10 minute practice sessions help maintain skills
- Consistent practice is more effective than cramming

### Important Notes

- 🔒 Future versions will include user accounts for progress tracking
- 📝 This tool is designed for student self-help and independent practice
- 🐛 Debug mode is disabled by default; enable it only for development/testing

## 💻 For Programmers

### Technologies Used

**Algebra Helper** is a single-file, client-side web application built with modern web technologies:

#### **Frontend Framework**
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No frameworks required—pure ES6+ JavaScript for maximum performance
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS via CDN for rapid UI development and consistent styling
- **MathJax 3**: LaTeX math rendering with SVG output for crisp, accessible mathematical notation

#### **Architecture & Algorithms**

**Binary Search Calibration with Statistical Confidence**
```javascript
// Finds optimal difficulty with confidence checks
if (student_knows) {
    minLevel = currentLevel;
} else {
    maxLevel = currentLevel;
}
nextLevel = (minLevel + maxLevel) / 2;

// Ends when multiple criteria are met:
// - Minimum 6 responses collected
// - Range converged to < 1.5 levels
// - Recent responses show mixed signals (both pass/fail)
// - Responses clustered around boundary level
```

**Adaptive Difficulty with Momentum**
- Correct answers: +0.2 level (or +0.5 in streak mode)
- First wrong answer: -0.3 level
- Consecutive wrong answers: -0.8 level (frustration breaker)

**Problem Generation**
- Procedural generation ensures infinite unique problems
- Each difficulty band has specific problem templates
- Distractors are algorithmically generated to be plausible but incorrect

#### **Key Features**

1. **No Backend Required**: All logic runs client-side—deploy to any static host
2. **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
3. **Fast Performance**: Question generation and rendering in <100ms
4. **Accessible**: MathJax provides screen-reader compatible math rendering

#### **Code Structure**
```javascript
APP {
    level: 5.0,           // Current difficulty (1-10)
    streak: 0,            // Consecutive correct answers
    mode: 'calibration',  // 'calibration' or 'learning'
    history: [],          // Binary success/fail for last 5
    speedHistory: [],     // Response speed: 1 for fast, 0.5 for normal, 0 for slow
}

Generator {
    getQuestion(level)    // Returns problem object
    lvl1() - lvl5()      // Problem templates per band
}
```

#### **Debug Mode**
Set `DEBUG_MODE = true` (line 105) to:
- Highlight correct answers with yellow border
- Add visual debug markers
- Enable rapid testing

## 🐛 Debug Mode

### What is Debug Mode?

Debug mode is a developer feature that visually highlights the correct answer in multiple-choice questions. It's useful for:
- Testing new problem types
- Verifying distractor generation logic
- Quick QA during development
- Demo/training purposes

### How to Enable/Disable

**Enable**: Set `DEBUG_MODE = true` in `algebra-helper.html` (line 105)
```javascript
const DEBUG_MODE = true;  // Correct answers have yellow dashed border
```

**Disable**: Set `DEBUG_MODE = false` (default for production)
```javascript
const DEBUG_MODE = false; // Production mode
```

### Important Warnings

⚠️ **Scores Are Not Saved in Debug Mode**
- Debug mode is for testing only
- Student progress will not persist
- Use production mode for real practice sessions

⏱️ **Debug Mode Timeout**
- Debug mode automatically expires after **10 minutes**
- This prevents accidental use in production environments
- Refresh the page to reset the timer

🔒 **Security Note**
- Debug mode is visible in client-side code
- For production deployments, consider a server-side flag
- Future versions will remove debug markers from production builds

### Debug Visual Indicators
- Yellow dashed border around correct answer
- "✓ DEBUG" badge in top-right corner of correct option
- Calculator/No-calculator icons for problem requirements
