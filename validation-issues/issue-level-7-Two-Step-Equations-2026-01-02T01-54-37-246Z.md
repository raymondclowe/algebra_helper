```latex
6x + 7 = 61
```

**Correct Answer:** x=9

**All Options:**
1. x=9
2. x=10
3. x=7
4. x=-9
5. I don't know
                    (no penalty)

**Analysis:**
- **Mathematical Correctness:** The equation is $6x + 7 = 61$. Subtracting 7 from both sides gives $6x = 54$. Dividing by 6 gives $x = 9$. The indicated correct answer ($x=9$) is accurate.
- **Difficulty:** This is a standard two-step linear equation with integer coefficients and an integer solution, perfectly suitable for a "Level 7" algebra topic.
- **Clarity:** The notation is standard and unambiguous.
- **Distractors:**
  - $x=10$ (close value, plausible estimation error)
  - $x=7$ (recurrence of a number in the problem)
  - $x=-9$ (plausible sign error: $7 - 61 = -54$)
  These are good distractors.
