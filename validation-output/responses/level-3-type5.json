Specifically, **18** is a very common mistake for students who confuse square roots with dividing by 2 ($36 \\div 2$). **5** and **7** are plausible \"close guess\" errors.\n*   **Topic:** While square roots are technically radicals/exponents, they are often grouped with multiplication facts at this level (inverse of squaring), so the categorization is acceptable.",
