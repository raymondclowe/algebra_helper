    "validationText": "VALID\n\n**Analysis:**\n1.  **Mathematical Correctness:** The problem asks to calculate $\\frac{2}{2} + \\frac{5}{6}$.\n    *   Method 1 (Simplification): $\\frac{2}{2} = 1$. So, $1 + \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{6}{6} + \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{11}{6}$.\n    *   Method 2 (Common Denominator): The common denominator for 2 and 6 is 6. $\\frac{2}{2} = \\frac{6}{6}$. Then $\\frac{6}{6} + \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{11}{6}$.\n    *   The indicated correct answer is $\\frac{11}{6}$, which is correct.\n2.  **Distractors:**\n    *   $\\frac{7}{8}$: Represents the common error of adding numerators and denominators straight across ($\\frac{2+5}{2+6}$).\n    *   $\\frac{6}{6}$: Represents just the value of the first term converted to the common denominator, ignoring the second term.\n    *   $\\frac{25}{6}$: A random distractor, possibly resulting from miscalculation.\n3.  **Level Appropriateness:** Adding fractions with unlike denominators is suitable for a Level 4 \"Working with Fractions\" module.\n4.  **Formatting:** The LaTeX rendering is clear and standard.",
