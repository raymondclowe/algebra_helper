**VALID**

The question is mathematically correct.

**Analysis:**
1.  **Function:** $f(x) = x \cdot 4x^4$
2.  **Simplification (Mental Check):** $f(x) = 4x^5$
3.  **Derivative:** Using the power rule on the simplified form, $f'(x) = 5 \cdot 4x^4 = 20x^4$.
4.  **Using Product Rule (as requested):**
    *   $u = x, u' = 1$
    *   $v = 4x^4, v' = 16x^3$
    *   $f'(x) = u'v + uv' = (1)(4x^4) + (x)(16x^3) = 4x^4 + 16x^4 = 20x^4$.

The marked correct answer ($20x^4$) is accurate. The distractors represent common errors (e.g., $4x^5$ is the original function simplified, $16x^3$ is the derivative of just the second term). The notation is clear.
