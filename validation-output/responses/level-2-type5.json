    "validationText": "VALID\n\n**Assessment:**\n- **Mathematical Correctness:** The question asks for the principal square root of 49. Since $7^2 = 49$, $\\sqrt{49} = 7$. The math is correct.\n- **Difficulty:** Level 2 is appropriate for basic perfect square roots.\n- **Clarity:** The notation is standard and unambiguous.\n- **Distractors:**\n  - 6 and 8 are good distractors as they are the integers adjacent to the correct answer (and correspond to $\\sqrt{36}$ and $\\sqrt{64}$).\n  - 24 is likely a distractor based on halving 49 (approx 24.5), which is a common misconception for students confusing square roots with division by 2.",
