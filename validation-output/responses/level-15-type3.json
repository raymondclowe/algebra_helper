    "validationText": "**Reviewing Question Context**\n\nI'm focused on the provided question and its context. I see the question asks for values of X where F(X) is greater than zero. The HTML includes a function plot script, and I'll analyze how the function's definition and plot will help determine the solution. The plan is to verify it and check for the most efficient way to answer it.\n\n\n**Examining the Parabola**\n\nI've determined that the parabola opens upwards and crosses the x-axis at -3 and 3. The vertex's y-value, however, will be outside the given domain of the y-axis, causing the graph to appear truncated. Values of x where f(x) > 0 will be from negative infinity to -3 and from 3 to positive infinity.\n\n\n**Evaluating Function Behavior**\n\nI've carefully assessed the function definition $f(x) = 2(x+3)(x-3)$. The roots are at x = -3 and x = 3, confirming the x-intercepts. Considering the parabola's upward orientation and the provided axis limits, I anticipate the visual representation to be truncated, as the vertex will fall outside the displayed y-axis range. The solution must be based on the analysis from this definition.\n\n\n**Interpreting Question Elements**\n\nI've examined the question and the graphical representation, along with the options. The LaTeX rendering issue is a significant concern, presenting a blank space where the graph should be displayed, and the answer is mathematically correct based on the parabola's properties.\n\n\n**Synthesizing Findings and Bugs**\n\nI've just reviewed the question and have a clearer picture. The core mathematical content is sound, confirming the correct answer is provided, but I've identified critical display/rendering bugs: The LaTex brackets show where the graph should be but they are visible as text. Also, the HTML plot would show a truncated graph because the y-axis bounds are not wide enough.\n\n\n**Identifying Technical Flaws**\n\nI've determined that the provided mathematical question is sound. However, I noticed a critical bug: the LaTeX delimiters are visible, indicating a rendering problem. The function's graph also appears to be absent in the screenshot. The mathematical solution is accurate, but the display and rendering errors undermine the user experience.\n\n\n**Addressing Presentation and Plot**\n\nI'm now assessing the visual presentation, focusing on the screenshot's appearance and the HTML plot script. The blank LaTeX rendering, combined with the truncated graph potentially caused by the y-axis limitations, raises significant concerns. The solution is mathematically sound, but a broken rendering can significantly impact the user experience, especially regarding this Level 15 (IB Math) question.\n\n\n**Reviewing Presentation Flaws**\n\nI'm now investigating the presentation issues, primarily the visible LaTeX delimiters. The blank space for the graph, combined with these visible delimiters, creates a confusing user experience. Furthermore, the limited y-axis range will also obscure the vertex, meaning the graph looks disconnected. Addressing these graphical and visual flaws is crucial for clarity.\n\n\n",
