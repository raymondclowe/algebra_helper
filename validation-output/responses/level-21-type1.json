    "explanation": "Apply the chain rule: d/dx[(ax+b)^n] = n(ax+b)^(n-1) × a. Therefore f'(x) = 3(5x + 3)^2 × 5 = 15(5x + 3)^2."

    "validationText": "VALID\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Mathematical Accuracy:** The derivative of $f(x) = (5x + 3)^3$ is indeed calculated using the chain rule: $f'(x) = 3(5x + 3)^2 \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx}(5x+3) = 3(5x + 3)^2 \\cdot 5 = 15(5x + 3)^2$. The indicated correct answer is mathematically accurate.\n- **Distractors:**\n  - $3(5x + 3)^2$: Catches the common error of forgetting to multiply by the derivative of the inner function (chain rule).\n  - $5(5x + 3)^2$: Catches the error of using the inner derivative as the coefficient but forgetting the power rule coefficient.\n  - $15x^2$: A conceptual error distractor.\n- **Clarity:** The notation and instruction are standard and unambiguous.\n- **Difficulty:** Appropriate for a standard drill on the chain rule within an IB calculus context.",
