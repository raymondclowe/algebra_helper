**ISSUE FOUND**

While the calculation itself is mathematically correct ($2 \times 8 = 16$), the question is **invalid** due to a significant mismatch between the stated topic and the content.

**Specific Issues:**

1.  **Topic Mismatch:** The screen header explicitly identifies the topic as **"Working with Fractions"**. However, the problem presented ($2 \times 8$) is a basic integer multiplication problem. It contains no fractions, mixed numbers, or rational number operations. A student expecting to practice fractions will find this confusing and irrelevant to the learning objective.
2.  **Difficulty Level:** For an IB Math curriculum aligned tool, "Level 4" implies a certain degree of complexity. A simple multiplication table question like $2 \times 8$ is primary school level arithmetic and is likely far below the intended difficulty for this level, especially within a fractions module.

**How to Fix:**
*   **Option A (Match Content to Topic):** Change the numbers to involve fractions.
    *   *Example:* Calculate $\frac{2}{3} \times 8$
    *   *Example:* Calculate $2 \times \frac{4}{5}$
    *   *Example:* Calculate $\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{8}$
*   **Option B (Match Topic to Content):** If the intention is to test basic times tables, change the Topic Header to "Basic Arithmetic" or "Integer Multiplication" (though this is likely too simple for the target audience of an IB tool).
