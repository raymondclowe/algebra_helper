    "validationText": "**Reviewing the Problem**\n\nI'm currently focused on the math question, specifically its complex number format. The core issue revolves around multiplying complex numbers expressed in polar form. My initial analysis points to an angle calculation and amplitude multiplication. I believe I have the right starting point, but I'll need to double check the multiplication of the complex terms.\n\n\n**Determining the Solution**\n\nI've directly applied the multiplication rule for complex numbers in exponential form. The moduli were straightforward to handle; I simply multiplied them. Adding the arguments required a common denominator, but that was easily resolved to give me the argument $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. That gave me a product of $12e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{2}}$.\n\n\n**Assessing Potential Distractors**\n\nI'm now deeply analyzing the potential errors someone might make. The 'keeping the angle' or subtracting them seems like the most common trap. That division error feels plausible given the wording. I also verified the suitability of the question for the stated difficulty level and time limit, and it seems spot on for that math level.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Contextual Details**\n\nI've just finished analyzing the context of the problem, focusing on the UI elements and metadata. There's a mismatch between the top bar's \"Integration & Series\" label and the question's content on complex numbers, but this seems to be a display issue, a metadata error. The \"Level 30\" designation is unclear, however, since the meaning depends on the scale and curriculum. While the mismatch seems confusing, the question itself is mathematically valid, and that's the current priority.\n\n\n**Validating the Result**\n\nI've confirmed the math, re-checking the product of moduli and the addition of arguments. Everything checks out perfectly; $4 \\times 3 = 12$, and $\\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{2}$. This confirms the answer $12e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{2}}$. I've also verified the selection of the correct response.\n\n\n**Evaluating the Question's Clarity**\n\nI'm now focusing on the context mismatch. While the math is solid, the UI's conflicting category label (\"Integration & Series\") is concerning. It could definitely confuse students who are expecting integration problems. However, the problem statement itself, the expected solution, and the difficulty level, match the explicit prompt, and the math is correct, so I'll need to double check the user experience implications.\n\n\n**Isolating the Core**\n\nI'm now separating the question content from the UI inconsistencies. The crucial part for review is the mathematics itself, not the misleading \"Integration & Series\" label. I'm focusing solely on the problem statement $4e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{6}} \\times 3e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{3}}$ and its solutions to make sure I'm only reviewing the generation and not any UI mistakes. The level 30 designation seems appropriate for a complex number question. The text matches the automatically generated mathematics question perfectly.\n\n\n**Confirming All Components**\n\nI've just concluded a thorough review. All criteria are fully met; the mathematics are spot-on, and the answer, including distractors, is correct. There is no error. The only potential item for feedback is the spacing around the fraction in the exponent, which is aesthetically but not mathematically incorrect, and fully within typical LaTeX styling. The problem is now marked as OK.\n\n\n",
