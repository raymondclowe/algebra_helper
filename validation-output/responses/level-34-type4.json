    "validationText": "VALID\n\nThe question is mathematically correct and appropriate for the IB Math curriculum (Statistics/Hypothesis Testing).\n\n*   **Concept:** The significance level $\\alpha$ is defined as the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true, which is the definition of a **Type I error**.\n*   **Calculation:** $0.01$ is equal to $1\\%$.\n*   **Answer:** Therefore, \"1% probability of Type I error\" is the correct interpretation.\n*   **Distractors:** The distractors (Power, Confidence Level, Type II error) are well-chosen common misconceptions. For instance, the confidence level would be $1 - \\alpha = 99\\%$, not $1\\%$.",
