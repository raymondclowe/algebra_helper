    "validationText": "**ISSUE FOUND**\n\nWhile the arithmetic itself is correct ($15 + 9 = 24$), the question is **categorized incorrectly** and does not fit the stated topic.\n\n**Details:**\n*   **Topic Mismatch:** The topic is labeled as **\"Squares & Roots\"** (and \"Powers and Roots\" in your description), but the question is a simple linear equation involving basic addition ($? + 9 = 24$). There are no exponents, powers, square roots, or radicals involved in the problem or the solution.\n*   **Difficulty Level:** For an IB Math curriculum, even at Level 2, a simple subtraction problem ($24 - 9$) is likely too elementary unless it is intended as a very basic warm-up, but the lack of relevance to the topic is the primary failure.\n\n**Suggested Fixes:**\nTo align with the \"Squares & Roots\" topic, the question should be modified to involve those concepts. Here are a few examples of how to fix it:\n\n1.  **Involve a Square Root:**\n    *   Question: $\\sqrt{?} + 9 = 14$\n    *   Solution: $\\sqrt{?} = 5 \\rightarrow ? = 25$\n2.  **Involve a Square:**\n    *   Question: $?^2 + 9 = 25$\n    *   Solution: $?^2 = 16 \\rightarrow ? = 4$ (assuming positive root for this level)\n3.  **Involve Powers:**\n    *   Question: $2^? + 9 = 25$\n    *   Solution: $2^? = 16 \\rightarrow ? = 4$\n\nIf the intention was to test basic algebra, the topic label needs to be changed to \"Basic Algebra\" or \"Linear Equations\".",
