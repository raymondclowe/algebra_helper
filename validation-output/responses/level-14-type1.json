    "validationText": "**ISSUES FOUND**\n\nWhile the mathematics behind the question is correct, there are significant presentation and formatting errors that need to be addressed before this is suitable for students.\n\n**1. Formatting/Rendering Error (Major Issue):**\nThe instruction at the top of the screen displays raw code: `\\TEXT{FIND } A_{8}`.\n- It appears the command `\\TEXT` is not being recognized by your LaTeX renderer (standard LaTeX uses `\\text`).\n- Even if it were a valid command, it is not rendering. The student sees code syntax instead of a clean question prompt.\n- **Fix:** Change the source text to standard text or ensure the LaTeX renders properly. It should simply read: **\"Find $a_8$\"**.\n\n**2. Notation Inconsistency:**\n- The sequence is defined using a lowercase variable: $a_1 = 4$.\n- The question asks to find an uppercase variable: $A_8$ (inside the curly braces of the unrendered code).\n- In mathematics, $a$ and $A$ are distinct variables.\n- **Fix:** Ensure consistency. If the given term is $a_1$, the question should ask for $a_8$.\n\n**Mathematical Verification (for reference):**\n- **Formula:** $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$\n- **Calculation:** $a_8 = 4 + (8-1)(5) = 4 + 7(5) = 4 + 35 = 39$\n- **Correct Answer:** 39 (The option marked as correct is valid).\n- **Distractors:**\n   - 44: Common error using $n$ instead of $n-1$ ($4 + 8 \\times 5$). Good distractor.\n   - 34: Calculation error or finding $a_7$. Good distractor.\n\n**Summary of Action Items:**\n1.  Fix the rendering bug for the \"Find...\" text.\n2.  Change $A_8$ to $a_8$ to match the variable case used in the sequence definition.",
