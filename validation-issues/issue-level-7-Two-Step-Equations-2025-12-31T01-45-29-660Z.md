**ISSUES FOUND**

While the mathematics itself is correct (i.e., $x=6$ is indeed the solution to $4x=24$), there is a significant pedagogical error regarding the classification of the question.

**1. Topic Mismatch (Primary Issue):**
*   **The Issue:** The topic header is labeled **"Two-Step Equations"**, but the problem provided ($4x = 24$) is a **One-Step Equation**.
*   **Explanation:** To solve $4x = 24$, a student only needs to perform one operation: divide both sides by 4. A "Two-Step Equation" by definition requires two distinct inverse operations to isolate the variable (usually adding/subtracting a constant, followed by multiplying/dividing by a coefficient).
*   **Context:** For a "Level 7" (likely 7th grade or IB MYP Year 2) student, a one-step equation is likely too simple and does not test the skill indicated by the title.

**2. Suggested Fixes:**
You have two options to align the content with the label:

*   **Option A (Keep the Topic):** Change the equation to a valid two-step equation that yields the same answer or a similar integer answer.
    *   *Example:* Change the equation to **$4x + 6 = 30$**.
    *   *Solution:* Subtract 6 ($4x = 24$), then divide by 4 ($x = 6$). This matches the current correct answer key.
*   **Option B (Keep the Question):** Change the topic label to **"One-Step Equations"**.
