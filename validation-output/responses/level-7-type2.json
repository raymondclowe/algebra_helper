    "validationText": "not OK\n\nThe question is mathematically correct, but it is categorized under the wrong topic.\n\n**Issue:**\nThe topic label in the top-left corner (and provided in the context) is **\"Two-Step Equations\"**. However, the question asks for the gradient of a perpendicular line, which is a **Coordinate Geometry** or **Linear Functions** concept. Solving this does not involve solving a two-step algebraic equation (e.g., $2x + 4 = 10$).\n\n**Fix:**\nUpdate the topic metadata for this question to **\"Coordinate Geometry\"**, **\"Linear Graphs\"**, or **\"Gradients\"** to match the content.",
