    "validationText": "VALID\n\nThe question is mathematically correct and appropriate for the IB Math curriculum.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n*   **Correct Notation:** In IB Mathematics (and most higher-level statistics), the notation for a normal distribution is $X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$, where the second parameter is the variance, not the standard deviation.\n*   **Correct Answer:** Since the mean ($\\mu$) is 62 and the standard deviation ($\\sigma$) is 6, the variance is $6^2$ (or 36). Therefore, $N(62, 6^2)$ is the precise and correct notation.\n*   **Good Distractors:**\n    *   $N(62, 6)$ is a strong distractor, targeting the common student misconception that the second parameter is the standard deviation.\n    *   $N(6, 62)$ tests if the student knows the order of parameters.\n    *   $B(62, 6)$ tests if the student can distinguish between Normal and Binomial notation.",
