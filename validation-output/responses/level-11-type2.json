    "explanation": "To complete the square for x² + 16x: take half the coefficient of x, which is (16)/2 = 8, then square it: 8² = 64. Therefore x² + 16x + 64 = (x + 8)²."

    "success": true,
    "validationText": "VALID\n\nThe question is mathematically accurate and clearly worded.\n- **Calculation:** To complete the square for $x^2 + bx$, you add $(\\frac{b}{2})^2$. Here, $b=16$, so $(\\frac{16}{2})^2 = 8^2 = 64$.\n- **Answer:** The option marked as correct (64) is indeed correct.\n- **Distractors:** The distractors are plausible common mistakes:\n  - 8 (forgetting to square the half-coefficient)\n  - 32 (doubling instead of squaring, or miscalculation)\n  - 16 (using the coefficient itself)\n- **Level:** Appropriate for a basic check on quadratic skills for the target level.",
