    "explanation": "Differentiating u = x² + 1 gives du/dx = 2x, so du = 2x dx. This means x dx = du/2."

    "validationText": "VALID\n\nThe question is mathematically correct, clear, and appropriate for the topic of integration by substitution.\n\n*   **Mathematical Accuracy:** The derivative of $u = x^2 + 1$ is $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2x$, which leads to the differential $du = 2x \\, dx$. The marked correct answer is accurate.\n*   **Distractors:** The incorrect options represent common student errors (e.g., forgetting the coefficient, assuming $du = dx$).\n*   **Clarity:** The instruction \"Express du in terms of x and dx\" is precise.",
