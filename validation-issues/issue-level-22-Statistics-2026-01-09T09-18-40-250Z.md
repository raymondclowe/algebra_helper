**Question Text (LaTeX):**
```latex

            <div style="width: 400px; height: 300px; margin: 10px auto;">
                <canvas id="chart-065mqfaom"></canvas>
            </div>
            <script>
            (function() {
                if (typeof Chart === 'undefined') {
                    console.warn('Chart.js library not loaded yet');
                    return;
                }
                try {
                    const ctx = document.getElementById('chart-065mqfaom').getContext('2d');
                    new Chart(ctx, {
                        type: 'boxplot',
                        data: {"labels":["Group A","Group B"],"datasets":[{"label":"Groups","data":[[{"min":10,"q1":15,"median":20,"q3":25,"max":30}],[{"min":20,"q1":30,"median":40,"q3":50,"max":60}]],"backgroundColor":["rgba(255, 159, 64, 0.5)","rgba(75, 192, 192, 0.5)"]}]},
                        options: {"responsive":true,"plugins":{"legend":{"display":false},"title":{"display":true,"text":"Comparison of Two Groups"}}}
                    });
                } catch (e) {
                    console.error('Error creating chart:', e);
                }
            })();
            </script>
        
```

**Correct Answer:** Group B

**All Options:**
1. Group A
2. Both the same
3. Cannot be determined
4. Group B
5. I don't know
                    (no penalty)

not OK

**Issue:**
The question is impossible to answer because the data visualization (the boxplot chart) is not rendering in the screenshot. Instead of the chart, there are empty LaTeX display math delimiters (`\[` and `\]`) shown in the center of the screen. The student has no information about Group A or Group B to calculate the IQR.

**Detailed Explanation:**
1.  **Rendering Error:** The screenshot shows `\[` and `\]` with a large empty space between them. This suggests that the HTML code for the chart (provided in the prompt text) was accidentally wrapped in LaTeX math delimiters. Since HTML `<canvas>` elements cannot be rendered inside LaTeX math mode, the chart fails to appear.
2.  **Missing Context:** The question asks "Which group has the greater spread (IQR)?", but without the visual boxplots, the values for Q1 and Q3 are unknown to the user.

**Correction Required:**
1.  **Remove LaTeX Tags:** Remove the `\[` and `\]` delimiters surrounding the chart code in the question source. The HTML/JavaScript for the chart should stand alone to render properly.
2.  **Verify Rendering:** Ensure the Chart.js visualization appears visible to the user, showing the two boxplots side-by-side.

**Mathematical Verification (based on the provided code snippet):**
Once the chart is visible, the math is correct:
- **Group A:** $Q1 = 15$, $Q3 = 25$. $IQR = 25 - 15 = 10$.
- **Group B:** $Q1 = 30$, $Q3 = 50$. $IQR = 50 - 30 = 20$.
- **Comparison:** $20 > 10$, so **Group B** has the greater spread.
- The marked correct answer (Group B) is mathematically correct based on the hidden data.
