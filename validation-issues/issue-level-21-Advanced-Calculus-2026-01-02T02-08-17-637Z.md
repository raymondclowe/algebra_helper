**ISSUES FOUND**

There are several issues with this question that need to be addressed:

1.  **Duplicate Options:** The option $4x^1$ appears twice (top-left and bottom-left). In a valid multiple-choice question, all options must be unique.
2.  **Unconventional Notation (Simplification):** The correct answer is displayed as $4x^0$. While mathematically equivalent to $4$ (since $x^0 = 1$), it is standard mathematical practice to simplify the result. Students are taught that the derivative of a linear term is a constant. Presenting it as $4x^0$ is confusing and pedagogically weak. The same applies to the distractors (e.g., $4x^1$ should be $4x$).
3.  **Difficulty Labeling:** The topic is labeled "Advanced Calculus," but finding the second derivative of a simple monomial like $2x^2$ is an introductory calculus skill (basic power rule). This label is misleadingly high.

**Correct Solution:**
1.  Function: $f(x) = 2x^2$
2.  First Derivative: $f'(x) = 4x$
3.  Second Derivative: $f''(x) = 4$

**Suggested Fixes:**
*   **Simplify the Options:** Display the correct answer as **$4$** instead of $4x^0$. Display the distractor $4x^1$ as **$4x$**.
*   **Remove Duplicates:** Ensure the distractors are distinct. Good distractors could be:
    *   $4x$ (the first derivative)
    *   $2$ (incorrect constant)
    *   $0$ (third derivative)
    *   $x$ (variable error)
