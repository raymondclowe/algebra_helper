    "validationText": "**Examining the Problem's Structure**\n\nI've begun dissecting the math problem. The prompt directs a scalar multiplication of a vector. Contextually, the question originates from an IB-aligned educational app, implying a particular syllabus and expected level of mathematical understanding. I plan to note the simplicity of the problem itself, which should allow me to focus on the instructional design.\n\n\n**Solving and Assessing Answers**\n\nI've successfully computed the answer and cross-referenced it with the given options. Option 2, the correct one, perfectly aligns with my calculation, indicating the question's validity. Options 1 and 3 seem designed to catch common errors, such as incorrectly applying addition, which is insightful for assessing student understanding. The distractors are well-designed.\n\n\n**Deconstructing the Distractors**\n\nMy analysis of the distractor options is now complete. I've noted how Option 1 targets a common error by using addition instead of multiplication. Option 3 seems less obviously connected to typical mistakes, while Option 4 presents the original vector. The presence of these distractors effectively tests for fundamental misunderstandings of scalar multiplication. The question itself is a good test.\n\n\n**Reviewing the Metadata Conflict**\n\nThe core math question is straightforward scalar multiplication, with well-designed distractors. However, the metadata mismatch is concerning. The app's header incorrectly labels the question under \"Integration & Series,\" while the content and the prompt correctly identify it as a vector problem. This tagging error needs immediate correction, as it undermines the app's educational integrity and can confuse students.\n\n\n**Evaluating Difficulty and Issues**\n\nI've carefully considered the question's suitability. While the mathematical content is correct and the distractors are well-crafted for assessing common misunderstandings, the level 29 tag seems reasonable for basic vector arithmetic. My main concern is the header mismatch. The question's \"Integration & Series\" label in the app is incorrect; it should be 3D Vectors, as the prompt specifies. This is a critical metadata error needing immediate correction.\n\n\n**Reviewing the Overall Question's Quality**\n\nI've thoroughly reviewed the problem, performing the scalar multiplication to confirm the correct answer. The distractors effectively target potential misunderstandings, such as confusing scalar multiplication with addition or simply offering the original vector. However, the blatant metadata mismatch is a significant flaw, as the app labels the question under an unrelated topic. This error is a major issue.\n\n\n**Identifying the Discrepancy**\n\nI've carefully examined the question and performed the calculation, which yielded the correct answer. The distractors are designed well to identify misunderstandings. My primary concern remains the header in the app, which incorrectly labels the question under \"Integration & Series,\" when it's clearly a vector problem, causing a significant metadata conflict.\n\n\n**Addressing the UI/Metadata Conflict**\n\nThe core issue remains the misleading topic label \"Integration & Series\" within the app's interface. This is a critical metadata error that could disorient students. While the underlying math problem – straightforward scalar multiplication – is correctly formulated, the inaccurate categorization is a clear quality defect and will need correction.\n\n\n",
