**ISSUE: Multiple Correct Answers / Ambiguity**

There is a significant design flaw in the options provided for this question.

**Explanation:**
1.  **The Problem:** The question asks to add $\frac{4}{6} + \frac{2}{3}$.
    *   Finding a common denominator (6): $\frac{4}{6} + \frac{4}{6} = \frac{8}{6}$.
    *   Simplifying the result: $\frac{8}{6} = \frac{4}{3}$.
2.  **The Conflict:** Both $\frac{4}{3}$ (the intended correct answer) and $\frac{8}{6}$ (one of the distractors) are mathematically equivalent.
3.  **Ambiguity:** The instruction "FIND COMMON DENOMINATOR AND ADD" does not explicitly state "and simplify your answer." Therefore, a student who performs the addition correctly to get $\frac{8}{6}$ sees their exact answer as an option. If they select it and are marked wrong, it is unfair because their answer is mathematically correct.

**Recommendation:**
You must replace the distractor $\frac{8}{6}$ with a value that is actually incorrect to ensure there is only one valid choice.
*   **Suggested Replacement:** Change $\frac{8}{6}$ to something like $\frac{7}{6}$, $\frac{5}{6}$, or $\frac{2}{2}$ (result of incorrect cancellation).
