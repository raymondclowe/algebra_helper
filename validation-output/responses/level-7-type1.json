    "explanation": "To isolate x, we need to undo the multiplication by 4. We divide both sides by 4 to keep the equation balanced: 4x ÷ 4 = 24 ÷ 4, which gives x = 6."

    "validationText": "**ISSUES FOUND**\n\nWhile the mathematics itself is correct (i.e., $x=6$ is indeed the solution to $4x=24$), there is a significant pedagogical error regarding the classification of the question.\n\n**1. Topic Mismatch (Primary Issue):**\n*   **The Issue:** The topic header is labeled **\"Two-Step Equations\"**, but the problem provided ($4x = 24$) is a **One-Step Equation**.\n*   **Explanation:** To solve $4x = 24$, a student only needs to perform one operation: divide both sides by 4. A \"Two-Step Equation\" by definition requires two distinct inverse operations to isolate the variable (usually adding/subtracting a constant, followed by multiplying/dividing by a coefficient).\n*   **Context:** For a \"Level 7\" (likely 7th grade or IB MYP Year 2) student, a one-step equation is likely too simple and does not test the skill indicated by the title.\n\n**2. Suggested Fixes:**\nYou have two options to align the content with the label:\n\n*   **Option A (Keep the Topic):** Change the equation to a valid two-step equation that yields the same answer or a similar integer answer.\n    *   *Example:* Change the equation to **$4x + 6 = 30$**.\n    *   *Solution:* Subtract 6 ($4x = 24$), then divide by 4 ($x = 6$). This matches the current correct answer key.\n*   **Option B (Keep the Question):** Change the topic label to **\"One-Step Equations\"**.",
