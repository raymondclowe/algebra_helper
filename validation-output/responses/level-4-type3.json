    "validationText": "**INVALID / INCORRECT**\n\n**Issue:**\nThe question has **two correct answers** among the choices.\n1. The marked correct answer is **$\\frac{2}{5}$**.\n2. The distractor **$\\frac{8}{20}$** is mathematically equivalent to $\\frac{2}{5}$.\n\n**Explanation:**\nWhen solving $\\frac{2}{4} \\div \\frac{5}{4}$:\n1.  Convert division to multiplication by the reciprocal: $\\frac{2}{4} \\times \\frac{4}{5}$\n2.  Multiply numerators and denominators: $\\frac{2 \\times 4}{4 \\times 5} = \\frac{8}{20}$\n\nWhile $\\frac{2}{5}$ is the simplified form, $\\frac{8}{20}$ is also a correct value. A student who performs the calculation correctly but does not simplify immediately will see their exact answer ($\\frac{8}{20}$) as an option and select it, only to be marked wrong. This is unfair and confusing.\n\n**Suggestion to Fix:**\nReplace the distractor **$\\frac{8}{20}$** with a clearly incorrect value to ensure there is only one valid choice.\n*   **Suggested replacement:** $\\frac{5}{2}$ (the reciprocal of the answer) or $\\frac{8}{10}$.",
