Here, $P(\\text{red}) = \\frac{11}{13}$.\n*   **Options:** The correct answer ($\\frac{11}{13}$) is present. The distractors are good:\n    *   $\\frac{2}{13}$ represents the probability of *not* picking red.\n    *   $\\frac{13}{11}$ and $\\frac{11}{2}$ test the fundamental rule that probability cannot exceed 1.\n*   **Clarity:** The notation $P(\\text{red})$ is standard and unambiguous.",
