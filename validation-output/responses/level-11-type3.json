    "validationText": "VALID\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Mathematical Accuracy:** The calculation is correct. For the equation $x^2 + 2x + 5 = 0$, the coefficients are $a=1, b=2, c=5$. The discriminant is $b^2 - 4ac = (2)^2 - 4(1)(5) = 4 - 20 = -16$.\n- **Correct Answer:** The option marked as correct ($-16$) is indeed the correct answer.\n- **Distractors:** The distractors are plausible errors:\n  - $4$ (calculating only $b^2$)\n  - $20$ (calculating only $4ac$)\n- **Clarity:** The question is clear and unambiguous.\n- **Level:** Appropriate for an introductory check on quadratic theory/complex numbers at Level 11 (IB Math).",
