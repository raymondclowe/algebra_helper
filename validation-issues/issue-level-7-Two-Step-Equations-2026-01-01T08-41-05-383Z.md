**ISSUE FOUND**

While the mathematical operation and the answer key are correct, there is a significant metadata and categorization error.

**1. Topic Mismatch (Major Issue):**
*   **Current Label:** The topic is listed as **"Two-Step Equations"**.
*   **Actual Content:** The question asks to **"CONVERT TO PERCENTAGE"** ($0.9 \rightarrow 90\%$).
*   **Explanation:** This is a basic arithmetic problem involving decimals and percentages. It is **not** an algebra problem and does not involve solving an equation, let alone a two-step equation (e.g., $2x + 4 = 10$). The question is completely miscategorized.

**2. Difficulty Level (Context Issue):**
*   **Context:** You mentioned this is an "IB Math curriculum aligned" tool.
*   **Level 7:** In an IB context, "Level 7" typically refers to the highest grade on a 1-7 scale, implying advanced difficulty. Even if "Level 7" refers to "Grade 7" (approx. age 12-13), converting a simple decimal like $0.9$ to a percentage is a foundational skill (typically Grade 5/6) and is likely too easy for a dedicated "Level 7" practice module, especially one labeled as Algebra.

**3. Mathematical Correctness (Verified):**
*   The math itself is correct: $0.9 \times 100\% = 90\%$.
*   The distractors ($0.9\%$, $900\%$, $9\%$) are plausible common errors.

**Suggested Fixes:**
*   **Option A (Fix Metadata):** Change the Topic label to **"Number & Algebra: Percentages"** or **"Decimals to Percentages"** and adjust the difficulty level to a lower tier (e.g., Level 4 or 5).
*   **Option B (
