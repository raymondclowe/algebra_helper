## Gemini 3 Pro Validation Feedback

**ISSUES FOUND**

While the mathematics behind the question is correct, there are significant presentation and formatting errors that need to be fixed.

**1. LaTeX Rendering Error (Major Issue)**
The instruction at the top of the screen displays raw code: `\TEXT{FIND } A_{4}`.
- **Why it's wrong:** The student sees code syntax instead of a readable question. This is likely due to the command `\TEXT` being capitalized (LaTeX commands are case-sensitive and usually lowercase, e.g., `\text`) or the rendering engine failing to parse the string.
- **Fix:** Update the string to render properly. It should simply read **"Find $a_4$"**.

**2. Notation Inconsistency**
- **Why it's wrong:** The sequence is defined using a lowercase variable ($a_1 = 5$), but the question asks to find an uppercase variable ($A_4$). In mathematics, variables are case-sensitive, so $a$ and $A$ are technically different variables.
- **Fix:** Change the prompt to ask for **$a_4$** (lowercase) to match the definition $a_1$.

**Mathematical Verification (Correct):**
- Formula: $a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{n-1}$
- Calculation: $a_4 = 5 \cdot 3^{4-1} = 5 \cdot 3^3 = 5 \cdot 27 = 135$
- The marked correct answer (135) is correct.
- The distractor 45 is good (calculating $a_3$ instead of $a_4$).

**Summary of Fix:**
Change the header text from `\TEXT{FIND } A_{4}` to **Find $a_4$**.
