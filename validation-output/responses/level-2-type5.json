The marked correct answer is 8.\n*   **Distractors:** The distractors are plausible.\n    *   **32:** Catches students who divide by 2 instead of taking the square root.\n    *   **7 and 9:** Are the roots of nearby perfect squares (49 and 81), serving as reasonable estimates for a student who is unsure.\n*   **Notation:** The LaTeX rendering is clear.",
