**Examining the Details**

I'm focused on the math question, which centers on adding linear expressions. The critical piece of context here is the level designation: Level 12. My understanding is that this likely maps to Grade 12, so the question should be appropriate for a high school senior.


**Simplifying the Analysis**

I've finished the problem, which is simple addition of linear expressions, and now I'm evaluating the answer choices. I can see the app's selected answer is indeed correct, matching my result. The incorrect options highlight common errors, such as incorrectly combining terms or misapplying distribution.


**Refining the Critique**

I'm now formulating my review. The math itself is completely correct, but the question's suitability for a "Level 12" designation needs a strong critique. I'll emphasize the drastic mismatch between the required skill (basic addition) and the expected proficiency of a Grade 12 student. The distractors are fine for testing, but they're targeting a far lower grade level. I'll suggest a need to re-evaluate the app's internal difficulty scale, and potentially tag this problem differently.


**Reviewing the Assessment**

I'm now writing my review. The core critique centers on the question's suitability for a "Level 12" designation. I'll emphasize the drastic disconnect between the simple algebra required and the expected mathematical proficiency of a high school senior, particularly given the mention of IB curriculum alignment. I'll recommend the app re-evaluate the difficulty rating.


**Crafting the Verdict**

I'm now writing my review. The core of my argument centers on the significant discrepancy between the question's simplicity and its designated "Level 12," implying a Grade 12 or IB Math context. This makes the question inappropriate. I'll stress the need to re-evaluate the difficulty rating, suggesting either a lower level or a clear indication that it's remedial material.


**Evaluating the Verdict**

I am about to complete my review of this app math question. I've broken down the math, checked the options, and evaluated the difficulty. I'm focusing on concisely communicating the mismatch between the simple math and the "Level 12" designation in the review, stressing the incongruity, while staying focused on the review's core points. This question is elementary and unsuitable for the grade level implied.


**Addressing the Core Problem**

I'm now writing my review. The core point is the significant mismatch between the elementary algebra and the implied Grade 12 or IB curriculum level. I'll flag this as a critical issue. The question's simplicity renders it unsuitable for the stated difficulty, irrespective of the app's internal grading system.


**Analyzing the Mismatch**

I'm now fully immersed in the problem, and the disconnect between the question's simplicity and the app's difficulty designation has become the central focus. My review will highlight the blatant incongruity, particularly given the implications of the "Level 12" tag. I'll emphasize that the mathematical content is undeniably correct, but completely inappropriate for an intended Grade 12 or IB Math audience.
