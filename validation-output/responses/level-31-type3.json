    "explanation": "Using Euler's formula: z = r·e^(iθ) = r(cos θ + i·sin θ). Here: 3(cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}) + i·sin(\\frac{3\\pi}{2})) = 3(0 + i·-1) = -3i."

Topic Mismatch (Major Issue)**\n*   **The Issue:** The question is categorized under **\"Integration & Series\"** (visible in the top-left header) and described in your context as **\"Advanced Integration\"**. However, the problem asks to convert a complex number from exponential to Cartesian form. This is purely a **Complex Numbers** algebra problem. There is absolutely no integration, calculus, or series content in this",
