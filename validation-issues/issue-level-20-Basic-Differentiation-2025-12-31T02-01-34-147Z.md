**Reflecting on the Prompt**

I'm now understanding the task, starting with a screenshot and specific instructions. The challenge involves identifying the problem type and level. I must process the image, extract the relevant data, and eventually solve the mathematical problem. It's a structured approach, which I find quite intuitive.


**Evaluating the Math Content**

I'm now zeroing in on the core of the problem. It requires finding the inverse of a quadratic function, $f(x) = 5x^2$, with a crucial domain restriction, $x \ge 0$. This influences the choice of the correct inverse function. The marked answer $y = \frac{\sqrt{x}}{\sqrt{5}}$ seems promising. The next step is to rigorously derive the inverse and confirm its consistency with the multiple-choice options, including handling the square root.


**Verifying the Solution**

I've carefully verified the solution against the multiple-choice answers, comparing it with my derived inverse function. My process involved systematically solving for the inverse, factoring in the domain constraint. The given correct answer, $y = \frac{\sqrt{x}}{\sqrt{5}}$, is completely consistent, confirming its accuracy, and the other choices are incorrect.


**Reviewing the Metadata**

I'm now examining the surrounding context, finding a mismatch in the "Topic" label, claiming differentiation when the problem is clearly inverse functions, an algebra/pre-calculus concept. Level 20 suggests a standard high school math problem, with the given domain making the question well-posed. The notation and multiple-choice format are standard and acceptable.


**Identifying the Errors**

I'm now carefully pinpointing the key issues. The primary error lies in the misleading topic label -  the question assesses inverse functions, not differentiation. Moreover, the "Basic Differentiation" label in the user prompt is incorrect, as is "Basic Calculus" in the screenshot.  The question's context and level seem appropriate for the question's content.


**Addressing the Mislabeling**

I am now structuring my response, emphasizing the discrepancy between the "Basic Differentiation" topic and the actual requirement of finding an inverse function. I will state the correct mathematical derivation for the inverse to reconfirm the solution is mathematically sound, and then pinpoint the error.


**Confirming Mislabeling**

I am now structuring my response, emphasizing the conflict between the "Basic Differentiation" topic and the true nature of the problem, finding the inverse function. The question is clearly about inverse functions of quadratic functions. I am detailing the correct inverse function derivation, and will state the inconsistency to my final review.


**Formulating a Response**

My response will highlight the main issue: the topic's misalignment. The problem is correctly solved, but the "Basic Differentiation" label is wrong, as it focuses on inverse functions. I'll include the steps to solve the inverse function and explain the error's implications.
