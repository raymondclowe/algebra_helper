**ISSUE FOUND**

**1. Incorrect Topic Classification (Major Issue):**
*   **The Problem:** The topic label in the top-left corner is **"Vectors"**, but the question is purely about **Trigonometry**.
*   **Explanation:** The question asks for the double-angle identity for sine ($\sin(2\theta) = 2\sin\theta\cos\theta$). This is a standard trigonometric identity. While trigonometry is used *within* vector problems (e.g., dot products, cross products, direction angles), this specific question is a direct test of a trigonometric formula and contains no vector notation, concepts, or context.
*   **Fix:** Change the topic category to **"Trigonometry"** or **"Trigonometric Identities"**.

**2. Mathematical Content (Valid):**
*   The math itself is correct. The expansion of $\sin(2\theta)$ is indeed $2\sin\theta\cos\theta$.
*   The distractors are appropriate for this level, targeting common misconceptions (e.g., linearity errors like $2\sin\theta$).

**Summary:** The question content is mathematically sound, but it is miscategorized in the "Vectors" section, which would confuse a student studying that specific topic.
