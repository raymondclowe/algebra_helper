**Examining Question Design**

I'm currently focused on the prompt's initial request: analyzing the user's math question. My breakdown so far involves noting the core topic (Proof by Contradiction, targeting the irrationality of $\sqrt{3}$) and the starting point provided in the question's text. This groundwork will allow a structured evaluation of its effectiveness.


**Refining the Evaluation**

I'm now zeroing in on the nuances of the options presented, focusing on their correctness relative to the question's premise. The app's logic is vital: while $3 = \frac{p^2}{q^2}$ is a true statement, $3q^2 = p^2$ is the target, as it immediately reveals the critical divisibility characteristic pivotal for proof by contradiction. The "best" answer in this case is context-dependent.


**Clarifying Question Intent**

The analysis continues, with careful examination of the options and their derivation. It's become clearer that option 2 is *technically* correct based only on the instruction ("square both sides"). However, the question's hidden goal – guiding the student toward the core logic of the proof (divisibility) – favors option 3. I'm now assessing how well the question wording serves this pedagogical aim.


**Assessing Answer Ambiguity**

The core issue: the question's ambiguity. I now see the direct result of "squaring both sides" *is* present as an option, which makes the correct answer uncertain. Option 2 is a valid result but doesn't immediately serve the proof's purpose, while option 3 does. The design flaw: multiple correct answers, making it less a test of understanding and more a test of literal instruction following.


**Identifying Question Weakness**

I'm now fully immersed in the question's core issue: its potential for student confusion. Focusing on the immediate outcome of "squaring both sides," I see the ambiguity created by offering both the direct result and the rearranged form as viable options. This design undermines the question's effectiveness as an assessment tool.


**Pinpointing the Core Flaw**

I'm now zeroing in on the crucial point: the question's design inadvertently allows for multiple correct answers. Squaring both sides yields $3 = \frac{p^2}{q^2}$, yet the intended answer for the proof is $3q^2 = p^2$. This ambiguity undermines the question's effectiveness.


**Evaluating the Ambiguity**

I'm now fully focused on the core issue: the question's ambiguity stemming from multiple valid answers. While the rearranged form ($3q^2 = p^2$) is the intended outcome for the proof, the direct result of squaring ($3 = \frac{p^2}{q^2}$) is also correct. The question's current wording presents this flaw, creating confusion.


**Synthesizing the Core Issue**

I'm now focusing on the prompt's main flaw: ambiguity. Both $3 = \frac{p^2}{q^2}$ and $3q^2 = p^2$ are mathematically correct outcomes, yet the question only marks the latter as the "correct" answer. This creates a situation that undermines the question's effectiveness as it can lead to confusion.
