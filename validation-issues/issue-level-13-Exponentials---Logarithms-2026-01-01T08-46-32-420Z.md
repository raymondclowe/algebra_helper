**Status: ISSUE FOUND**

There is a significant metadata and classification error in this question.

**1. Topic Mismatch (Major Issue):**
*   **The Problem:** The top-left corner labels the topic as **"Exponentials & Logarithms"**. However, the question asks the student to **"Complete the Square"** for a quadratic expression ($x^2 + 8x$).
*   **Why it's wrong:** Completing the square is a fundamental algebraic technique related to quadratic functions and polynomials. It has no direct connection to exponentials or logarithms in this context. A student practicing logs would be confused to see this question.

**2. Difficulty Level Appropriateness (Secondary Issue):**
*   **The Problem:** The level is marked as **"13"**. In an IB curriculum context (where Year 13 is the final year of high school), this question is far too elementary.
*   **Why it's wrong:** Comple
