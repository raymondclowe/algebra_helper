The range is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values.\n  - Maximum value = $57$\n  - Minimum value = $15$\n  - Range = $57 - 15 = 42$\n- **Clarity:** The question is unambiguous.\n- **Distractors:** The distractors are plausible:\n  - $15$ is the minimum value.\n  - $57$ is the maximum value.\n  - $36$ is a reasonable random distractor (close to $57-21$).\n- **Difficulty:** The question is very simple arithmetic, suitable for a \"No Calc\" speed drill or an introductory statistics review.",
