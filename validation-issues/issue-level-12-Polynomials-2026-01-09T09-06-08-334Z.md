**2. Evaluating the Options**

I'm now zeroing in on the provided function to see if I can even begin to assess whether (x-5) is a factor. I'm thinking I'll need to use the factor theorem. The app's curriculum alignment is also important to consider as I refine my answer for maximum effectiveness.


**3. Refining the Solution**

The factor theorem and direct factoring seem to be the most efficient methods for this problem. Given the IB Math context, I believe the core concept of the Factor Theorem is crucial for these learners to grasp. I will now compare this to a direct factorization and evaluate how the solution can support both methods in one concise response.


**4. Confirming the Solution**

I've confirmed the solution using the factor theorem and direct factoring. Both methods confirm that (x - 5) is indeed a factor. I've also checked the distractors, which seem appropriate. Now, I will evaluate the difficulty of the level, keeping in mind the app's potential curriculum alignment.


**5. Reconsidering the App Level**

I'm now giving deeper thought to the "Level 12" designation. If this app is truly IB Math-aligned, as stated, the question's simplicity suggests it's more appropriate for earlier levels of the curriculum. The "Level 12" could refer to chapter progression within the app, which makes it less important. The focus remains on content accuracy, even if the placement feels potentially basic.


**6. Summarizing the Assessment**

Now, I've thoroughly checked the mathematics and distractors. The core math is valid and the correct answer is provided. The distractor "Only if x > 0" is not relevant, but it does serve to test understanding, so no errors detected. While "Level 12" appears deceptively high, and the question is simple, it can still function as a valid introduction.


**7. Concluding the Review**

I've conducted the verification, and reviewed the level's appropriateness. My final check focuses on the context of IB Math. While the question is simple, it serves its purpose. The prompt's focus on brevity is met. The answer is "OK," which would be the only output, per instructions.


**8. Final Assessment of Accuracy**

I've carefully considered the level of difficulty again and confirmed the solution. My final, overarching assessment is that the provided math is correct, all the distractors are incorrect, and there are no issues. Therefore, my response is "OK".
