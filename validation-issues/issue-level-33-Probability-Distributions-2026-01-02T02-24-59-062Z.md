**Understanding Standardization**

I'm currently focused on the user's request, specifically the IB Math question on normal distribution standardization. I'm parsing the prompt now. It involves transforming a random variable X into a standard normal variable Z. I am identifying the core concept needed to answer the question, and will start to build out an explanation.


**Deconstructing The Options**

The analysis continues by evaluating provided options. The top-left option is quickly identified as incorrect, as it neglects the division by the standard deviation, therefore it only centers the distribution. I am now evaluating the top right option, to ensure it is also incorrect.


**Verifying The Solution**

The solution has been meticulously evaluated and compared to the user's requirements. The standard score formula was confirmed as $Z = (X - \mu) / \sigma$. Specific parameters from $X \sim N(84, 7^2)$ were extracted, and the values were successfully applied. All distractors were examined and eliminated. The final correct response has been verified as $Z = (X - 84) / 7$. I've also checked the level of the question, and the use of notations.


**Refining The Categorization**

My current focus has shifted to the educational app's metadata. While the question and solution are mathematically sound, the question is incorrectly categorized. The UI shows "Integration & Series" as the topic instead of "Probability Distributions". I will make a note of this discrepancy.


**Synthesizing The Verdict**

I've determined that the mathematical question is valid and correctly answered. The distractors are well-crafted and the notation is appropriate for the target audience. However, I've noted a metadata discrepancy – the UI incorrectly categorizes the topic as "Integration & Series" instead of "Probability Distributions." I will record this as a minor suggestion, as the core mathematical content is sound.


**Synthesizing The Review**

Having validated the question's mathematical correctness and appropriateness for the IB curriculum, the focus is now entirely on the final verdict and any minor recommendations. The math is sound, notation is unambiguous and clear, and the distractors are well-crafted. Despite the question's validity, there is a UI discrepancy, where the topic is mislabeled as "Integration & Series" instead of "Probability Distributions" in the metadata.


**Formulating The Response**

The question is mathematically correct and appropriate for the IB curriculum, the distractors are plausible and the notation is standard. The UI incorrectly labels the topic as "Integration & Series" instead of "Probability Distributions". I will provide the verdict, including a note on the UI.


**Confirming The Conclusion**

I'm now fully prepared to provide the final answer, and it confirms the mathematical validity of the question and the appropriateness for the IB curriculum. The distractors are correctly crafted, and the notation is standard. While the question's content is sound, there's a UI error: The topic is mislabeled in the metadata, as "Integration & Series" instead of "Probability Distributions." I will communicate the verdict with a note on the mislabeling.
