    "validationText": "**Status: ISSUES FOUND**\n\nWhile the mathematics itself is correct, there are significant issues regarding the difficulty level and notation for the stated context.\n\n**1. Difficulty Level Mismatch (Major Issue)**\n*   **The Problem:** The question is labeled **\"Level: 12\"** within an **IB Math curriculum** context. In standard educational terms, Level 12 corresponds to Grade 12 (final year of high school, IB Diploma Programme).\n*   **Why it's wrong:** The content—adding two linear binomials—is **Pre-Algebra or Algebra 1 material** (typically Grades 7-8). An IB Math student at Level 12 would be studying Calculus, Vectors, or Complex Numbers. This question is far too elementary for the stated level.\n*   **Fix:** This question should be categorized as **Level 7 or 8** (or \"Beginner/Introductory\" within the Polynomials topic).\n\n**2. Notation Style (Minor Issue)**\n*   **The Problem:** The term $1x$ is explicitly written with a coefficient of 1.\n*   **Why it's wrong:** While mathematically valid, standard mathematical convention omits the coefficient 1 (writing $x$ instead of $1x$). Explicitly writing $1x$ is usually reserved for the very first introduction to variables for young students. For a \"Level 12\" or even high school level question, this looks unprofessional and computer-generated.\n*   **Fix:** The generator should simplify coefficients of 1 to just the variable (e.g., write $x + 1$ instead of $1x + 1$).\n\n**Mathematical Verification (For Reference):**\n*   **Question:** $(5x + 8) + (1x + 1)$\n*   **Solution:** Combine like terms: $(5x + 1x) + (8 + 1) = 6x + 9$\n*   **Answer Key:** The selected answer ($6x + 9$) is mathematically correct.\n*   **Distractors:** The distractors are plausible for a beginner student making arithmetic errors.",
