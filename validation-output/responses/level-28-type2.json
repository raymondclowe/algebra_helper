    "validationText": "**Reviewing the System's Behavior**\n\nI've examined the question's text, which asks about a 3x3 system and its possibilities given det(A) = 0. My next step will be to delve into the options. I'm focusing on the nature of the determinant and what it implies about the system. I will identify the correct option, which is Option A.\n\n\n**Evaluating Solution Scenarios**\n\nI'm now diving into the implications of det(A) = 0 for the given 3x3 system. My focus is narrowing to option A, and I'm justifying why, while simultaneously eliminating others. I'm verifying the possibilities using rank analysis.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Solution**\n\nI'm presently dissecting the options and justifying the selection of option A. The core is analyzing how the zero determinant of matrix A shapes the system's possible solution sets. I've also incorporated a rank analysis to refine the reasoning and I've also assessed the level of the question, and the mismatch in the UI.\n\n\n**Identifying App Mismatches**\n\nI've examined the question's text, options, and mathematical context. Option A is clearly the correct answer. There's a notable metadata mismatch: the UI incorrectly categorizes this matrix algebra question under \"Integration & Series\". This is a significant issue. Additionally, \"Exactly no/infinite solutions\" are slightly awkward phrases, but the core issue is the topic mislabeling.\n\n\n**Refining Categorization Concerns**\n\nI've carefully considered the question's mathematical validity and wording. The core issue now is the significant metadata mismatch; the screenshot shows an incorrect topic categorization (\"Integration & Series\") for a matrix algebra question. I must also consider the implied non-homogeneous system. This categorization error, in conjunction with potentially misleading phrasing, prevents me from simply saying \"OK\".\n\n\n**Addressing UI and Wording Issues**\n\nI've carefully considered the math and the options, confirming option A is correct. Now I'm focused on app-related details: a significant metadata issue where a matrix algebra question is categorized under \"Integration & Series\". The non-standard phrasing like \"Exactly no/infinite solutions\" also raises concerns, but it's secondary to the incorrect topic labeling shown by the UI.\n\n\n**Evaluating Content Accuracy**\n\nI've carefully analyzed the mathematical logic of the question and all the options. Option A is undeniably the correct answer, given det(A) = 0. However, I've noted awkward phrasing, especially the \"exactly\" phrasing, which is secondary to the UI issue.\n\n\n**Evaluating the Options and Issues**\n\nI've examined the question and options, confirming option A is mathematically correct, while the phrasing needs improvement. However, I've concluded the most significant issue is the incorrect topic categorization, as indicated in the provided UI screenshot. I will now prepare a concise response.\n\n\n",
