**ISSUE FOUND**

There is a significant **categorization error** in this question.

**1. Topic Mismatch:**
*   **The Issue:** The header in the top-left corner identifies the topic as **"Lvl: 16: Trigonometry Basics"**. However, the question asks for the **"Sum of arithmetic series"**, which is an Algebra topic (Sequences and Series), not Trigonometry.
*   **Why it matters:** A student practicing trigonometry would be confused to encounter a question about arithmetic progressions. It indicates a database tagging error.

**2. Mathematical Verification (The math itself is correct):**
*   The question asks for the sum of an arithmetic series with $a_1 = 1$, $d = 1$, and $n = 10$.
*   This is effectively the sum of the first 10 integers: $1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 10$.
*   Using the formula $S_n = \frac{n}{2}(2a_1 + (n-1)d)$:
    $$S_{10} = \frac{10}{2} [2(1) + (10-1)(1)]$$
    $$S_{10} = 5 [2 + 9]$$
    $$S_{10} = 5 [11]$$
    $$S_{10} = 55$$
*   The provided correct answer (55) is mathematically accurate.

**3. Recommendation:**
*   **Fix the Category:** Change the topic label from "Trigonometry Basics" to **"Sequences and Series"** or **"Arithmetic Progressions"**.
*   **Alternatively:** If this level is strictly for Trigonometry, replace the question content with a relevant problem (e.g., "Calculate $\sin(30^\circ)$" or "Find the hypotenuse given...").
