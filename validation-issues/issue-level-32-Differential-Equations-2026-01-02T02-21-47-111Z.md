**Assessing the Differential**

I'm focused on the differential equation aspect now, specifically the request to find the differential du. The level 32 designation confirms the need for calculus knowledge, so I'm thinking through the derivative rules needed for that calculation. My current thought is to break down the equation and apply the relevant differentiation techniques.


**Determining the Derivative**

I've worked through the solution, applying the rules of differentiation to find $du$. It's clear that the correct answer is $du = 2x \, dx$. I'm checking the other options to confirm this. I will look for any subtle ways to make errors.


**Revisiting the Formatting**

I've examined the presentation of the answer options more closely. It appears there's a rendering issue with the LaTeX, as the backslashes `\` are showing literally, which creates inconsistencies. The rendering is also using different fonts which draws the user's attention unnecessarily. I'm focusing on why the formatting isn't rendering properly.


**Assessing the Rendering**

I'm now fully immersed in the formatting issue. The inconsistency is glaring. The top two options appear to have raw LaTeX showing. The others are rendered with proper math fonts, creating a fragmented presentation. I need to flag that the LaTeX rendering has broken, which introduces a notation error, despite the correct answer being mathematically sound.


**Addressing the Presentation**

I've finished a detailed examination of the question and answer options. My main point of concern is the inconsistent rendering of the LaTeX, particularly the visible backslashes. This formatting error needs attention, as it introduces confusing notation, even though the underlying mathematics is sound.


**Examining the Rendering Glitches**

I've just finished a deeper dive into the root cause of the formatting problem. It's clear that the LaTeX parser isn't working as intended, leading to the display of literal LaTeX code in certain options. This formatting issue impacts readability and can potentially confuse users unfamiliar with LaTeX syntax.


**Refining the Response**

I'm now formulating my response, emphasizing the critical rendering flaws. Specifically, I'll flag the visible LaTeX syntax, the inconsistent font styles, and the impact this has on the overall presentation. My goal is to clearly and concisely communicate the issue while acknowledging the underlying mathematical correctness.


**Finalizing the Analysis**

I've made my final decision. The core mathematical content is correct, but there's a significant rendering issue. The LaTeX is not processing correctly, and this introduces confusing notation, directly violating the prompt's requirement for clarity. I'm now drafting a concise report, highlighting the formatting failures and their potential to confuse users.
