    "validationText": "VALID\n\n**Analysis:**\n1.  **Mathematical Correctness:** The quadratic equation is $x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0$. Factoring this gives $(x - 2)(x - 3) = 0$, resulting in two solutions: $x = 2$ and $x = 3$.\n2.  **Instruction Compliance:** The prompt explicitly asks for the \"SMALLER SOLUTION\". Comparing the two roots ($2$ and $3$), $2$ is the smaller value.\n3.  **Answer Verification:** The option marked as correct is $x = 2$, which is accurate.\n4.  **Distractors:**\n    *   $x = 3$: This is the other valid root, catching students who miss the \"smaller solution\" instruction.\n    *   $x = -2$: Catches sign errors in factoring (e.g., $(x+2)(x-3)$).\n    *   $x = 5$: Plausible guess based on the coefficient of the $x$ term.\n\n**Note on Difficulty:** For an IB Math curriculum (Level 11/Grade 11), this is a fundamental skill (GCSE/IGCSE level) and serves as a basic fluency check or warm-up question. It is solvable well within the 30-60 second timeframe.",
