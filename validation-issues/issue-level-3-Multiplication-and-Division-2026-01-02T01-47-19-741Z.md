**ISSUES FOUND**

There is a significant categorization error regarding the topic of the question.

**1. Topic Mismatch:**
*   **Issue:** The provided topic is **"Multiplication and Division"**, but the question presented ($? + 9 = 30$) is an **Addition/Subtraction** problem.
*   **Explanation:** The operation shown is addition ($+$), and solving for the missing number requires subtraction ($30 - 9$). There is no multiplication or division involved in this equation.
*   **Fix:**
    *   **Option A:** Change the topic metadata to "Addition and Subtraction" or "Basic Algebra".
    *   **Option B:** Change the question to match the "Multiplication and Division" topic (e.g., change the equation to $? \times 3 = 30$ or $? \div 3 = 10$).

**2. Mathematical Validity (Minor Note):**
*   The math itself is correct. $21 + 9 = 30$. The correct answer (21) is present and identified correctly. The distractors are plausible for this level. However, the question cannot be approved due to the topic mismatch described above.
