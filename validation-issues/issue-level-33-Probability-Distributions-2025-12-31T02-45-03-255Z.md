**ISSUE DETECTED**

**Problem:**
The correct answer is displaying a **floating-point precision error** rather than the exact value.
- The calculation for the expected value of a Binomial distribution $B(n, p)$ is $E(X) = n \times p$.
- Here: $12 \times 0.2 = 2.4$.
- The option displays `2.4000000000000004`. This is a raw computer artifact (likely IEEE 754 floating-point standard) and is confusing/unprofessional for a student. It suggests the answer is an approximation or an irrational number, when it is actually a terminating decimal.

**Correction:**
The correct answer option should simply be **2.4**.

**Suggestion for Fix:**
Implement a rounding function or string formatting on the generated answers to limit decimal places (e.g., to the significant figures appropriate for the inputs) to avoid displaying raw floating-point garbage values.
