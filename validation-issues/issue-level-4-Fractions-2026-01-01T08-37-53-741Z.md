## Gemini 3 Pro Validation Feedback

**INVALID / INCORRECT**

**Issue:**
The question has **two correct answers** among the choices.
1. The marked correct answer is **$\frac{2}{5}$**.
2. The distractor **$\frac{8}{20}$** is mathematically equivalent to $\frac{2}{5}$.

**Explanation:**
When solving $\frac{2}{4} \div \frac{5}{4}$:
1.  Convert division to multiplication by the reciprocal: $\frac{2}{4} \times \frac{4}{5}$
2.  Multiply numerators and denominators: $\frac{2 \times 4}{4 \times 5} = \frac{8}{20}$

While $\frac{2}{5}$ is the simplified form, $\frac{8}{20}$ is also a correct value. A student who performs the calculation correctly but does not simplify immediately will see their exact answer ($\frac{8}{20}$) as an option and select it, only to be marked wrong. This is unfair and confusing.

**Suggestion to Fix:**
Replace the distractor **$\frac{8}{20}$** with a clearly incorrect value to ensure there is only one valid choice.
*   **Suggested replacement:** $\frac{5}{2}$ (the reciprocal of the answer) or $\frac{8}{10}$.
