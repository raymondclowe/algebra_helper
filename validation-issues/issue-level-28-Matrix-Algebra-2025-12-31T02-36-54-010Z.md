**Evaluating the Matrix Question**

I'm currently focused on the specific matrix question. It involves finding the inverse of a 2x2 matrix, which should be straightforward. I'm taking a close look at the provided text and plan to check the question's clarity, and difficulty level.


**Verifying Solution Accuracy**

I've successfully solved the matrix problem, yielding the inverse as (1/10) multiplied by the matrix [[4, -3], [-2, 4]]. The provided correct answer matches my solution. I'm now proceeding to thoroughly review the available options for any flaws, and verify the "DEBUG" tag's correctness.


**Concluding the Question's Analysis**

I've carefully examined the question, solved it, and scrutinized the options. The correct answer, clearly labeled, aligns with my calculation. I also assessed the question's difficulty, appropriateness for the stated level, and clarity, confirming its validity. I'm satisfied.


**Reviewing Question Adequacy**

I've carefully examined the question's structure and options, confirming the correct answer's accuracy. I'm now investigating the quality of the distractors, their likely causes, and the overall question's alignment with the stated topic. I've re-reviewed the screenshot, and noticed a mismatch between the tag and the actual question's content, but this doesn't change the question's validity.


**Confirming Question's Validity**

I've completed my analysis of the question, solving it accurately, and assessing the distractor quality. I've concluded the question itself is mathematically sound and suitable. I also noticed a mismatch between the header's topic and the question's content, which I've flagged as a minor UI issue.


**Confirming Question's Validity**

I've completed my analysis of the question, successfully solving it, and assessing the distractor quality. The math is correct, and the question is suitable for the stated level. I'll note that the header's topic, "Integration & Series," doesn't align with the actual "Matrix Algebra" content, which is a UI mismatch. Also, the distractor with the "1/1" coefficient isn't stylistically perfect. However, in terms of math, it is perfectly valid.


**Confirming Final Verdict**

I've rigorously analyzed the question, verified the solution's accuracy, and assessed the distractor quality, concluding the math is flawless. I will be responding with "VALID," along with a brief note highlighting the UI's header mismatch with the actual matrix algebra content. I've also noted a minor stylistic issue with a distractor.
