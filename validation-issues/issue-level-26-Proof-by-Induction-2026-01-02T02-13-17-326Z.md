## Question Details

**Question Text (LaTeX):**
```latex
\text{Given: } 1+2+\cdots+k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}
```

**Correct Answer:** \frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}

**All Options:**
1. 𝑘⁢(𝑘+1)2 +𝑘
2. (𝑘+1)⁢(𝑘+2)2
3. (𝑘+1)22
4. 𝑘⁢(𝑘+2)2
5. I don't know
                    (no penalty)

**ISSUES FOUND**

While the mathematics behind the question is correct, there is a significant formatting error in the question prompt that needs to be fixed.

**1. Formatting/Display Issue:**
*   **Problem:** The question text at the top is missing spaces between words. It currently reads:
    *"Whatis1+2+...+k+(k+1)insimplifiedform?"*
*   **Cause:** This usually happens in LaTeX when writing normal text inside a math environment without using `\text{}` or proper spacing, or simply by omitting spaces in the string generation.
*   **Fix:** Ensure spaces are included in the string. It should read:
    *"What is $1 + 2 + \cdots + k + (k+1)$ in simplified form?"*

**2. Mathematical Verification (for confirmation):**
*   **Logic:** The question asks for the inductive step.
    $$ \text{Sum} = \left(\sum_{i=1}^{k} i\right) + (k+1) $$
    $$ \text{Sum} = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} + (k+1) $$
    $$ \text{Sum} = (k+1)\left(\frac{k}{2} + 1\right) $$
    $$ \text{Sum} = (k+1)\left(\frac{k+2}{2}\right) = \frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2} $$
*   **Correct Answer:** The option marked as correct (top right) is $\frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}$, which is mathematically accurate.
*   **Distractors:** The distractors are distinct and incorrect.

**Summary:** The question is mathematically valid, but the **text formatting in the prompt must be corrected** to be legible and professional.
