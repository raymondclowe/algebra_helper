    "validationText": "VALID\n\nThe question is mathematically correct and appropriate for the context.\n\n*   **Reasoning:** In hypothesis testing, the null hypothesis ($H_0$) typically states that a population parameter is equal to a specific value (the status quo). The phrase \"differs from\" indicates a two-tailed test where the alternative hypothesis ($H_1$) would be $\\mu \\neq 57$. Therefore, the correct null hypothesis is indeed $\\mu = 57$.\n*   **Distractors:** The distractors are well-chosen, representing the alternative hypothesis ($\\neq$) or one-sided hypotheses ($<$ or $>$), which are common student misconceptions.\n*   **Notation:** The notation used is standard and clear.",
