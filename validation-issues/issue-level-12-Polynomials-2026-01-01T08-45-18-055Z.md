**Examining Question Details**

I'm currently reviewing a mathematics question and it appears to be about polynomials. The educational app designates the question as Level 12, so the expected difficulty level seems to align with advanced high school coursework, potentially IB or AP.


**Investigating the Solution Path**

I've just confirmed the user's solution using both the Factor Theorem and by directly factoring the quadratic. The answer, "Yes", is validated. I'm noting the unrefined notation in the question: " + -4" instead of "- 4." This could be a minor aesthetic issue or potentially a clue about how the question was constructed. I plan to note this observation.


**Verifying Question Correctness**

My review confirms the question is mathematically sound and presents a simple, correct solution. I've successfully employed the Factor Theorem and factoring to validate the user's "Yes" answer. I find the question valid and the distractor options appropriate.


**Critiquing the Question Thoroughly**

My review is now complete. I've noted the question is mathematically sound and the correct answer is available. However, the notation issue is more than just cosmetic; the unsimplified " + -4" hints at potential coding flaws or unrefined question generation. I'm also carefully considering the suitability of the question's difficulty level for its labeled designation. The distractors are adequate.


**Summarizing Findings Concisely**

I've determined that the mathematical question is valid, with the provided "Yes" answer verified through factoring and the Factor Theorem. The notation issue remains, with "$+ -4$" appearing unpolished. The level designation as "Level 12" is questionable for IB math.


**Evaluating Final Verdict**

I am now focusing on the final response, confirming the notation flaw ($+ -4$) and the question's potentially low difficulty relative to a Grade 12 (IB) level. The distractors are fine; the math is correct. I will emphasize the formatting and the questionable difficulty, despite the question's validity.


**Formulating the Final Response**

I'm now fully committed to the conclusion. The primary issue is the notation in "$+ -4$", which reflects a lack of polish. I'll also note the question's simplicity in relation to its supposed level. The distractors are appropriately constructed. The math is faultless, and I will now compose the detailed response, focusing on the identified flaws.
