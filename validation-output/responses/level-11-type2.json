    "validationText": "VALID\n\n**Assessment:**\n- **Mathematical Correctness:** The question asks to complete the square for the expression $x^2 + 16x + \\_\\_$. To find the constant term, one takes half of the coefficient of $x$ ($16/2 = 8$) and squares it ($8^2 = 64$). The resulting perfect square trinomial is $(x+8)^2$. The logic is sound.\n- **Correct Answer:** The option marked as correct (64) is indeed the correct answer.\n- **Distractors:**\n  - **8:** Represents the value of half the coefficient ($\\frac{b}{2}$), a common intermediate step students stop at.\n  - **16:** Represents the coefficient itself ($b$), a common error of just copying the number.\n  - **32:** Represents $16 \\times 2$, a plausible arithmetic confusion.\n  These are good, plausible distractors.\n- **Clarity:** The wording is standard and unambiguous.\n- **Difficulty:** Appropriate for a high school algebra level (IB Math / Grade 11 context) as a fundamental skill check. It is easily solvable within the 30-60 second timeframe.",
