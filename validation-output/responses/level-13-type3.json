    "validationText": "VALID\n\n**Assessment:**\nThe question is mathematically correct and well-structured.\n- **Correctness:** The application of the product rule for logarithms ($\\log_b(x) + \\log_b(y) = \\log_b(xy)$) correctly leads to $\\log(4 \\times 3) = \\log(12)$.\n- **Distractors:** The distractors are effective:\n    - $\\log(7)$ catches the common error of adding the arguments ($\\log(a+b)$).\n    - $\\log(4) \\times \\log(3)$ catches the error of confusing the log of a product with the product of logs.\n- **Clarity:** The instruction \"Simplify using log laws\" is unambiguous.\n- **Difficulty:** This is a fundamental skill for the topic of Exponentials & Logarithms, suitable for an introductory question within that unit (Level 13 implies an intermediate algebra stage where logs are typically introduced).",
