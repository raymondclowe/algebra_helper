    "explanation": "First, subtract 6 from both sides to isolate the term with x: 2x = 4. Then divide both sides by 2 to get x alone: x = 2. Remember: we perform inverse operations in reverse order of operations (PEMDAS backwards)."

Topic Mismatch (Major Issue)**\n*   **The Issue:** The question is categorized under the topic **\"Inequalities\"** (visible in the top-left corner), but the problem presented ($2x + 6 = 10$) is a **Linear Equation**.\n*   **Explanation:** By definition, an inequality must use inequality symbols such as $<$, $>$, $\\leq$, or $\\geq$. The presence of an equals sign ($=$) makes this an equation, not an inequality. A student practicing \"Inequalities\" would be confused by receiving a standard equation.\n\n### **2. Difficulty Level Discrepancy**\n*   **The Issue:** The question is marked as **\"Level: ",
