    "validationText": "VALID\n\n**Assessment:**\nThe question is mathematically sound and appropriate for a unit on Matrix Algebra.\n\n*   **Correctness:** The operation asks for the product of a $2 \\times 2$ matrix and the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix. By definition, $A \\cdot I = A$. The highlighted correct answer matches the original matrix exactly, which is correct.\n*   **Distractors:** The distractors are well-chosen based on common student errors:\n    *   Top Right represents matrix addition ($A + I$).\n    *   Top Left represents an incorrect element-wise operation (keeping only diagonal elements).\n    *   Bottom Right is the identity matrix itself, checking if the student confuses the result with the operator.\n*   **Clarity:** The notation is standard and the instruction \"MULTIPLY BY THE IDENTITY MATRIX\" is explicit.\n*   **Difficulty:** This serves as an excellent conceptual check that can be solved quickly (under 10 seconds), fitting the time constraints perfectly.",
