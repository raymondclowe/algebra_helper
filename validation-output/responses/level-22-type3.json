The number $23$ appears three times, while $12$ and $26$ appear once. Therefore, $23$ is the correct mode.\n- **Clarity:** The question is concise and unambiguous.\n- **Options:**\n  - The correct answer ($23$) is present and marked.\n  - The distractors ($12$, $26$, \"no mode\") are plausible errors (confusing mode with min/max or misunderstanding the concept).\n- **Difficulty:** Appropriate for a basic statistics check.",
