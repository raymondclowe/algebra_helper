    "validationText": "**Evaluating the Question's Merit**\n\nI'm now assessing the question's suitability. The topic is clear: De Moivre's Theorem applied to complex numbers in polar form. The level seems appropriate for the specified curriculum. I need to now focus on the instruction \"USE DE MOIVRE'S THEOREM TO SIMPLIFY\", to determine if the question effectively tests the required skills, and whether the question is worded appropriately.\n\n\n**Refining the Solution Steps**\n\nI've reviewed the proposed solution steps, ensuring clarity and correctness. The breakdown of applying the power rule, calculating the modulus, and employing De Moivre's Theorem seems sound. I'm now verifying the calculations and ensuring the final answer aligns with the initial expression and the provided answer keys.\n\n\n**Examining the Options Critically**\n\nAfter a thorough review of the options, I've identified their strengths and weaknesses. The marked correct answer is mathematically sound, but its level of simplification is debatable given the instruction. The other options reveal common errors, which is good for pedagogical purposes. I'm now analyzing the app's overall goal in asking this question.\n\n\n**Final Assessment and Recommendations**\n\nI've completed my analysis. While the marked answer is mathematically sound, the question's focus leans towards applying De Moivre's Theorem over complete simplification. The distractors effectively target common errors. I'd recommend clarifying the expectation of simplification in the instructions. The notation could be standardized for clarity.\n\n\n**Assessing the Pedagogical Impact**\n\nMy focus has shifted to the educational goals. This question effectively targets understanding and applying De Moivre's Theorem within the context of complex numbers in polar form. The distractors successfully highlight common misconceptions, and the question should be considered valid. I now think of how to refine the wording to be even clearer for the students.\n\n\n**Considering Clarity of Wording**\n\nI'm now contemplating the question's wording. While mathematically sound, I'm assessing if the instruction to \"simplify\" could mislead. The notation $i4\\frac{\\pi}{6}$ is also under scrutiny. I need to balance the mathematical correctness of the question with how a student will interpret the instructions and the choices.\n\n\n**Analyzing Question Metadata**\n\nI've observed a potential metadata issue: the question is about complex numbers, yet the app categorizes it under \"Integration & Series.\" I'll flag this, though it doesn't impact the mathematical validity of the question itself, which remains solid in my assessment.\n\n\n",
