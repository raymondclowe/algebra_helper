not OK

**Issue:**
The question text is not visible to the student. Instead, a yellow error box is displayed containing the message: `\] is only supported in math mode`.

**Explanation:**
This is a technical LaTeX rendering error caused by the formatting code in the question text. Specifically, the command `\\[0.5em]` (used to create a line break with extra spacing) is placed inside a `\text{...}` block.
