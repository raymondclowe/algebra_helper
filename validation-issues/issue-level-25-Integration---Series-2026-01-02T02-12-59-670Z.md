## Gemini 3 Pro Validation Feedback

The question contains a **mathematical error** regarding the correct answer provided.

**Issue:**
The marked correct answer is **4**, but the actual mathematical sum of the series is **4/3** (or approx. 1.33).

**Detailed Explanation:**
The expression is an infinite geometric series: $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (0.25)^n$

1.  **Identify the components:**
    *   **First term ($a$):** When $n=0$, $(0.25)^0 = 1$. So, $a = 1$.
    *   **Common ratio ($r$):** The base of the exponent is $0.25$. So, $r = 0.25$ (or $1/4$).

2.  **Apply the Sum to Infinity formula ($S_{\infty} = \frac{a}{1 - r}$):**
    $$S_{\infty} = \frac{1}{1 - 0.25}$$
    $$S_{\infty} = \frac{1}{0.75}$$
    $$S_{\infty} = \frac{1}{3/4}$$
    $$S_{\infty} = \frac{4}{3}$$

**Why the current answer is wrong:**
It appears the answer key calculated the reciprocal of the ratio ($1 / 0.25 = 4$) rather than using the correct geometric series formula. Alternatively, the question author might have intended the ratio to be $0.75$ (since $\frac{1}{1-0.75} = 4$).

**Suggested Fix:**
*   **Option A (Fix the Answer):** Change the correct answer option from **4** to **4/3** (or **1.33**).
*   **Option B (Fix the Question):** If the answer must be **4**, change the question to: $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (0.75)^n$
