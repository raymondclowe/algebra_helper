    "validationText": "**INCORRECT**\n\nThere is a mathematical error in the question setup. The provided \"correct\" answer does not match the solution to the inequality shown.\n\n**Detailed Explanation:**\n1.  **Solving the displayed inequality:**\n    $$5x + 10 < 23$$\n    Subtract 10 from both sides:\n    $$5x < 13$$\n    Divide by 5:\n    $$x < 2.6$$ (or $x < \\frac{13}{5}$)\n\n2.  **The issue:**\n    The option marked as correct is **$x < 2$**.\n    However, the actual solution is **$x < 2.6$**.\n    The statement $x < 2$ is not the correct solution set for the given inequality (it misses values like 2.1, 2.5, etc.).\n\n**Suggested Fix:**\nIt appears there is a typo in the constant term on the right side of the inequality. To make the answer **$x < 2$** correct, change the number **23** to **20**.\n\n**Revised Question:**\n$$5x + 10 < 20$$\n*(Solution: $5x < 10 \\rightarrow x < 2$)*",
