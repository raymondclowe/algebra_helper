    "validationText": "VALID\n\nThe question is mathematically correct and appropriate for the level.\n\n**Analysis:**\n*   **Concept:** The question correctly identifies the \"Induction Hypothesis\" step of mathematical induction, which is assuming the statement $P(n)$ is true for $n=k$.\n*   **Correct Answer:** The option marked as correct (bottom right) correctly substitutes $k$ for $n$ in the given formula: $1 + 2 + ... + k = \\frac{k(k+1)}{2}$.\n*   **Distractors:** The distractors are well-chosen common errors:\n    *   Top-left mixes the sum for $k$ with the formula for $k+1$.\n    *   Bottom-left mixes the sum for $k+1$ with the formula for $k$.\n    *   Top-right omits the division by 2.\n*   **Notation:** The transition from sigma notation in the question to expanded series notation in the answers is a good pedagogical check of understanding.",
