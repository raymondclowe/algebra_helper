    "validationText": "VALID\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Mathematical Correctness:** The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(2a_1 + (n-1)d)$.\n  Substituting the given values:\n  $S_{10} = \\frac{10}{2}(2(4) + (10-1)(1))$\n  $S_{10} = 5(8 + 9)$\n  $S_{10} = 5(17)$\n  $S_{10} = 85$\n  The calculation is correct.\n- **Options:** The correct answer (85) is present. The distractors are plausible:\n  - **17:** Result of $a_1 + a_n$ (forgetting to multiply by $n/2$).\n  - **40:** Result of $\\frac{n}{2} \\times 2a_1$ (ignoring the common difference term).\n- **Clarity:** The notation is standard and the question is unambiguous.\n- **Difficulty:** Appropriate for a quick mental math check of the formula.",
