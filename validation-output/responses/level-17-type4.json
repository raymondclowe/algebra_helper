The instruction to find the \"smallest value\" correctly distinguishes between the two possible solutions in the given domain ($30^\\circ$ and $150^\\circ$). The distractors correspond to common special angle values ($\\cos(60^\\circ)$, $\\sin(90^\\circ)$, etc.), making them appropriate for testing exact value knowledge.",
