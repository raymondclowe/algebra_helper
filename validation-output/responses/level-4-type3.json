    "validationText": "VALID\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Mathematical Correctness:** The operation is $\\frac{3}{2} \\div \\frac{5}{4}$. To solve, multiply by the reciprocal: $\\frac{3}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{12}{10}$. Simplifying this fraction gives $\\frac{6}{5}$. The marked correct answer is $\\frac{6}{5}$, which is correct.\n- **Instructions:** The prompt explicitly asks to \"DIVIDE AND SIMPLIFY\".\n- **Distractors:**\n  - $\\frac{12}{10}$: This is the correct value but unsimplified. This is an excellent distractor to test if the student followed the \"simplify\" instruction.\n  - $\\frac{15}{8}$: This is the result of multiplying instead of dividing ($\\frac{3}{2} \\times \\frac{5}{4}$), a common student error.\n  - $\\frac{3}{10}$: A plausible incorrect value.\n- **Presentation:** The LaTeX rendering is clear and standard. The difficulty level (4) is appropriate for fraction division involving simplification.",
