    "validationText": "**ISSUE DETECTED**\n\n**Problem:**\nThe correct answer is displaying a **floating-point precision error** rather than the exact value.\n- The calculation for the expected value of a Binomial distribution $B(n, p)$ is $E(X) = n \\times p$.\n- Here: $12 \\times 0.2 = 2.4$.\n- The option displays `2.4000000000000004`. This is a raw computer artifact (likely IEEE 754 floating-point standard) and is confusing/unprofessional for a student. It suggests the answer is an approximation or an irrational number, when it is actually a terminating decimal.\n\n**Correction:**\nThe correct answer option should simply be **2.4**.\n\n**Suggestion for Fix:**\nImplement a rounding function or string formatting on the generated answers to limit decimal places (e.g., to the significant figures appropriate for the inputs) to avoid displaying raw floating-point garbage values.",
