## Gemini 3 Pro Validation Feedback

The question has **ISSUES**.

**1. Incorrect Topic Classification (Major Issue)**
The topic header is labeled **"Quadratic Equations"**, but the problem asks to expand $4(x + 2)$.
*   The result of this expansion is $4x + 8$, which is a **linear expression** (degree 1).
*   A quadratic equation or expression must contain a squared term (degree 2), such as $x^2$.
*   This is a fundamental categorization error.

**2. Difficulty Level Mismatch**
The level is marked as **11**. In an IB or standard curriculum context, Level/Grade 11 corresponds to students aged 16-17.
*   Expanding a single bracket by a constant (distributive property) is typically taught in **Grade 7 or 8** (Pre-Algebra).
*   This question is far too easy for the stated level.

**How to Fix:**
*   **Option A (Match the Topic):** Change the expression to one that results in a quadratic.
    *   *Example:* Expand $4x(x + 2)$ $\rightarrow$ Answer: $4x^2 + 8x$
    *   *Example:* Expand $(x + 4)(x + 2)$ $\rightarrow$ Answer: $x^2 + 6x + 8$
*   **Option B (Match the Content):** Change the topic label to "Expanding Linear Expressions" or "Basic Algebra" and lower the difficulty rating significantly (e.g., to Level 7 or 8).
