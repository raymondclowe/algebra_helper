    "validationText": "**ISSUE: Multiple Correct Answers**\n\nThe question is mathematically ambiguous because there are two equally valid standard substitutions for the integral $\\int \\sin(x) \\cos(x) \\, dx$, both of which are presented as options.\n\n**Detailed Explanation:**\n1.  **Option A ($u = \\sin(x)$)** is valid:\n    *   $du = \\cos(x) \\, dx$\n    *   The integral becomes $\\int u \\, du$.\n\n2.  **Option B ($u = \\cos(x)$)** is **ALSO valid**:\n    *   $du = -\\sin(x) \\, dx \\implies -du = \\sin(x) \\, dx$\n    *   The integral becomes $\\int -u \\, du$.\n\nSince both substitutions are standard, efficient, and correct, it is unfair and confusing to list $u = \\cos(x)$ as a distractor (incorrect answer). A student selecting this option would be mathematically correct but penalized by the system.\n\n**Suggested Fix:**\nChange the distractor **Option B** ($u = \\cos(x)$) to a clearly incorrect substitution to remove ambiguity.\n*   **Example replacements:** $u = \\tan(x)$, $u = x^2$, or $u = \\sin(x) + x$.",
