## Gemini 3 Pro Validation Feedback

The question has **ISSUES**.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the problems:

**1. Incorrect Topic Classification**
*   **Issue:** The topic label in the top-left corner is **"Sequences & Series"**. However, the problem asks the student to **"FACTORISE"** the quadratic expression $x^2 + 3x + 2$.
*   **Explanation:** Factorising a quadratic trinomial is a fundamental **Algebra** or **Quadratics** topic. It has no direct relation to Sequences & Series (arithmetic/geometric progressions, sigma notation, etc.) unless it were part of a larger context which is not present here.
*   **Fix:** Change the topic category to **"Algebra"**, **"Polynomials"**, or **"Quadratics"**.

**2. Inappropriate Difficulty Level**
*   **Issue:** The question is marked as **"Level: 14"**.
*   **Explanation:** Factorising $x^2 + 3x + 2$ is a very basic algebraic skill, typically taught in early high school (Grade 9/10). In the context of an IB Math curriculum, this is foundational assumed knowledge. A "Level 14" rating implies a high degree of difficulty or an advanced topic, whereas this is an introductory level problem (likely Level 1 or 2).
*   **Fix:** Lower the difficulty level significantly to reflect that this is a basic review question.

**3. Mathematical Correctness (Verified)**
*   The math itself is correct.
    *   Problem: Factorise $x^2 + 3x + 2$
    *   Solution: We need two numbers that multiply to 2 and add to 3. These are 1 and 2.
    *   Result: $(x+1)(x+2)$
*   The marked correct answer `(x+1)(x+2)` is correct.
*   The distractors are plausible common errors.

**Summary Recommendation:**
The content is mathematically sound, but the **metadata is wrong**. You must reclassify this question under **Algebra/Quadratics** and drastically **reduce the difficulty level**.
