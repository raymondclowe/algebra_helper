## Gemini 3 Pro Validation Feedback

**ISSUE FOUND**

There is a significant mismatch between the stated **Topic** and the **Question Content**.

**Explanation:**
1.  **Topic Mismatch:** The topic is labeled as **"Multiplication & Division"** (visible in the top-left corner and the prompt), but the problem presented is **$? + 14 = 20$**. This is an **addition/subtraction** problem (finding a missing addend). It does not test multiplication or division skills.
2.  **Pedagogical Confusion:** A student selecting a "Multiplication & Division" module expects to practice factors, products, or quotients. Encountering a basic addition problem breaks the learning flow and does not assess the intended skill.

**How to Fix:**
*   **Option A (Change Question):** Replace the equation with one that fits the topic.
    *   *Example:* $? \times 4 = 20$ (Answer: 5)
    *   *Example:* $14 \div ? = 2$ (Answer: 7)
*   **Option B (Change Topic):** If the intention is to test this specific equation, change the Topic label to **"Addition & Subtraction"** or **"Pre-Algebra"**.
