    "validationText": "**ISSUE FOUND**\n\n**1. Incorrect Topic Classification (Major Issue):**\n*   **The Problem:** The topic label in the top-left corner is **\"Vectors\"**, but the question is purely about **Trigonometry**.\n*   **Explanation:** The question asks for the double-angle identity for sine ($\\sin(2\\theta) = 2\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta$). This is a standard trigonometric identity. While trigonometry is used *within* vector problems (e.g., dot products, cross products, direction angles), this specific question is a direct test of a trigonometric formula and contains no vector notation, concepts, or context.\n*   **Fix:** Change the topic category to **\"Trigonometry\"** or **\"Trigonometric Identities\"**.\n\n**2. Mathematical Content (Valid):**\n*   The math itself is correct. The expansion of $\\sin(2\\theta)$ is indeed $2\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta$.\n*   The distractors are appropriate for this level, targeting common misconceptions (e.g., linearity errors like $2\\sin\\theta$).\n\n**Summary:** The question content is mathematically sound, but it is miscategorized in the \"Vectors\" section, which would confuse a student studying that specific topic.",
