    "questionType": 2,
    "questionText": "7x + 5 = 40",
    "instruction": "Solve for x",
    "correctAnswer": "x=5",
    "distractors": [
      "x=6",
      "x=-5",
      "x=3"

      "x=6",

      "I don't know\n                    (no penalty)"
    ],
    "explanation": "First, subtract 5 from both sides to isolate the term with x: 7x = 35. Then divide both sides by 7 to get x alone: x = 5. Remember: we perform inverse operations in reverse order of operations (PEMDAS backwards)."
