    "validationText": "**ISSUES FOUND**\n\nWhile the mathematics behind the question is correct, there are significant presentation and formatting errors that need to be fixed.\n\n**1. LaTeX Rendering Error (Major Issue)**\nThe instruction at the top of the screen displays raw code: `\\TEXT{FIND } A_{4}`.\n- **Why it's wrong:** The student sees code syntax instead of a readable question. This is likely due to the command `\\TEXT` being capitalized (LaTeX commands are case-sensitive and usually lowercase, e.g., `\\text`) or the rendering engine failing to parse the string.\n- **Fix:** Update the string to render properly. It should simply read **\"Find $a_4$\"**.\n\n**2. Notation Inconsistency**\n- **Why it's wrong:** The sequence is defined using a lowercase variable ($a_1 = 5$), but the question asks to find an uppercase variable ($A_4$). In mathematics, variables are case-sensitive, so $a$ and $A$ are technically different variables.\n- **Fix:** Change the prompt to ask for **$a_4$** (lowercase) to match the definition $a_1$.\n\n**Mathematical Verification (Correct):**\n- Formula: $a_n = a_1 \\cdot r^{n-1}$\n- Calculation: $a_4 = 5 \\cdot 3^{4-1} = 5 \\cdot 3^3 = 5 \\cdot 27 = 135$\n- The marked correct answer (135) is correct.\n- The distractor 45 is good (calculating $a_3$ instead of $a_4$).\n\n**Summary of Fix:**\nChange the header text from `\\TEXT{FIND } A_{4}` to **Find $a_4$**.",
