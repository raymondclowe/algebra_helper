not OK

The question contains **two correct answers** among the choices, which creates ambiguity and penalizes students who simplify their answer.

**Detailed Explanation:**
The problem asks for the derivative $\frac{dy}{dx}$ of the equation $xy = 1$.

1.  **Using Implicit Differentiation (as instructed):**
    $$x \cdot \frac{dy}{dx} + y \cdot 1 = 0$$
    $$x \cdot \frac{dy}{dx} = -y$$
    $$\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{y}{x}$$
    This matches the intended correct answer (bottom-left option).

2.  **Using Explicit Differentiation:**
    Rewrite $y$ as $y = \frac{1}{x} = x^{-1}$.
    $$\frac{dy}{dx} = -1 \cdot x^{-2} = -\frac{1}{x^2}$$
    This matches the top-right option ($-\frac{1}{x^2}$).

**The Issue:**
Since $y = \frac{1}{x}$, the expression $-\frac{y}{x}$ is mathematically
