    "validationText": "VALID\n\nThe question is mathematically correct, clear, and unambiguous.\n\n**Analysis:**\n*   **Correctness:** The equation $\\sin(x) = 0.5$ has two solutions within the domain $0^\\circ \\le x < 360^\\circ$: $30^\\circ$ and $150^\\circ$. The question asks for the \"smallest solution,\" which is $30^\\circ$. The marked answer is correct.\n*   **Distractors:** The incorrect options ($45^\\circ$, $60^\\circ$, $90^\\circ$) are common standard angles that students often confuse with the correct value, making them effective distractors.\n*   **Notation:** The use of degrees and mathematical notation is correct.\n*   **Difficulty:** While labeled \"Advanced Trigonometry,\" solving $\\sin(x) = 0.5$ is a fundamental skill involving exact values (unit circle). It is appropriate for a \"No Calc\" practice module.",
