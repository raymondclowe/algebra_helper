    "validationText": "**ISSUES FOUND**\n\nWhile the mathematical logic for the correct answer is sound, there is a significant technical/presentation error in the distractors.\n\n**1. Floating Point Display Error (Major Issue):**\nThe distractor `0.8999999999999999` is a bug.\n- **Explanation:** This value is clearly intended to be `0.9` (derived from the common student mistake of adding probabilities: $0.6 + 0.3 = 0.9$). The app is displaying the raw result of a floating-point calculation (standard IEEE 754 precision error) instead of a formatted number.\n- **Fix:** The answer generation code must round or format numbers to a specific number of decimal places (e.g., 2 decimal places) before displaying them. The option should simply read `0.9`.\n\n**2. Difficulty Level Mismatch (Minor Issue):**\n- **Observation:** The question is labeled \"Level: 24\" and \"Advanced Probability\".\n- **Critique:** Applying the basic definition of independence ($P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\times P(B)$) is a fundamental, introductory concept, not \"Advanced\". \"Advanced\" usually implies conditional probability, Bayes' theorem, or complex combinatorics.\n- **Suggestion:** Verify if this difficulty rating aligns with the rest of the curriculum.\n\n**Mathematical Verification:**\n- **Correct Answer:** The logic is correct. For independent events, $P(A \\text{ and } B) = P(A) \\times P(B) = 0.6 \\times 0.3 = 0.18$. The correct option provided is valid",
