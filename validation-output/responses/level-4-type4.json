    "validationText": "**ISSUE: Multiple Correct Answers / Ambiguity**\n\nThere is a significant design flaw in the options provided for this question.\n\n**Explanation:**\n1.  **The Problem:** The question asks to add $\\frac{4}{6} + \\frac{2}{3}$.\n    *   Finding a common denominator (6): $\\frac{4}{6} + \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{8}{6}$.\n    *   Simplifying the result: $\\frac{8}{6} = \\frac{4}{3}$.\n2.  **The Conflict:** Both $\\frac{4}{3}$ (the intended correct answer) and $\\frac{8}{6}$ (one of the distractors) are mathematically equivalent.\n3.  **Ambiguity:** The instruction \"FIND COMMON DENOMINATOR AND ADD\" does not explicitly state \"and simplify your answer.\" Therefore, a student who performs the addition correctly to get $\\frac{8}{6}$ sees their exact answer as an option. If they select it and are marked wrong, it is unfair because their answer is mathematically correct.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nYou must replace the distractor $\\frac{8}{6}$ with a value that is actually incorrect to ensure there is only one valid choice.\n*   **Suggested Replacement:** Change $\\frac{8}{6}$ to something like $\\frac{7}{6}$, $\\frac{5}{6}$, or $\\frac{2}{2}$ (result of incorrect cancellation).",
