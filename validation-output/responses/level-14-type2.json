    "validationText": "**Assessing the Prompt Content**\n\nOkay, I'm currently focused on the initial prompt content. I've begun to break down the wording of the math question. So far, the core elements like the principal, time, rate, and the final value are clear. I'm starting to think about what potential pedagogical issues might arise.\n\n\n**Reaching a Conclusion**\n\nI have a solution to the problem, and verified the calculations. The correct option is $902, which is consistent with the output. Therefore, the problem is solved.\n\n\n**Pinpointing LaTeX Problems**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the LaTeX rendering issue. The problem seems to stem from how the line break command, `\\\\[0.5em]`, is handled within the `\\text{...}` environment. It's likely that the LaTeX interpreter used by the system has a conflict when line breaks are attempted within `\\text{...}` mode, especially when paired with a newline that ends the expression in a math display mode, `\\[ ... \\]`. I believe this is the central technical difficulty to address.\n\n\n**Diagnosing the Error Source**\n\nI'm now diving deeper into the LaTeX error. The `\\] is only supported in math mode` message seems misleading initially. I've considered that the renderer might implicitly wrap the input in math delimiters. Analyzing `\\text{... \\\\[0.5em] ...}` indicates `\\\\[...]` should be valid in display math. Further examination of inline vs. display math contexts seems essential to isolate the source.\n\n\n**Estimating the Principal Value**\n\nI've been analyzing the compound interest problem's difficulty. Determining the principal from the future value involves rearranging the formula, $P = A / (1+r)^n$. I've considered the feasibility of solving it within the given time limit. Calculating $1200 / 1.331$ is feasible. I've found that $902$ is a great estimate, and is exact with a calculator.\n\n\n**Evaluating the Distractors**\n\nI've taken a close look at the distractors, and I believe they are effective. I'm now fully confident in the solution. Further, the question is good. However, I'm now back at the rendering, and still confident that the issue lies in the system handling of LaTeX environments, and specifically the interaction between line breaks and text mode within display math environments.\n\n\n**Suggesting the Best Approach**\n\nI've been analyzing the best approach for the LaTeX issue. Currently, I believe the problem is specifically related to line breaks within `\\text{...}` and different renderers. My current thinking is to recommend a solution that avoids this problematic combination entirely. I'll propose separating text and math elements, or alternatively, utilizing a display math environment. This is both robust and likely the best practice.\n\n\n**Refining LaTeX Strategies**\n\nI'm now assessing potential fixes for the LaTeX rendering issue, focusing on how the system's LaTeX parser functions. My thought is now to remove the need for LaTeX wrapper and use plain english text, or find a compatible LaTeX syntax. It seems necessary to revise the LaTeX code structure to work with KaTeX or MathJax.\n\n\n",
