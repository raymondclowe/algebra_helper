2. **Design:** Create 5-10 question variations per topic
3. **Implement:** Add to appropriate `/js/question-templates/` file
4. **Test:** Use validation tool (`tools/README.md`)
5. **Document:** Update all relevant documentation files
6. **Review:** Request code review before merging

### Quality Standards

- ✅ Align with IB syllabus language and difficulty
- ✅ Correct mathematics and LaTeX rendering
- ✅ Plausible distractors based on common errors
- ✅ Clear, unambiguous question wording
- ✅ Appropriate for target level
- ✅ "Why" question variants for conceptual understanding

### File Locations

- **Question templates:** `/js/question-templates/[topic].js`
- **Topic mapping:** `/js/topic-definitions.js`
- **Generator routing:** `/js/generator.js`
- **Coverage docs:** `IB_HL_AA_COVERAGE.md`
