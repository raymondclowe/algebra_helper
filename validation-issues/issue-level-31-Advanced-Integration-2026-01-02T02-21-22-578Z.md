**Reviewing the Integral**

I'm currently focused on the mathematics question, starting with understanding the indefinite integral. My next step will be to apply the most appropriate integration technique. I'm considering u-substitution as the initial approach given the structure of the integrand.


**Evaluating the Solution**

After solving the integral using u-substitution, I arrived at $\frac{3}{2}(x^2 + 1)^4 + C$.  I'm now cross-referencing my solution against the multiple-choice options provided by the app, and verifying by differentiating the given choices. Option A looks promising because it is a similar form but not quite there, and B is already incorrect.


**Confirming the Integral**

I've re-calculated the integral, paying close attention to the coefficients. The correct indefinite integral is $\frac{3}{2}(x^2 + 1)^4 + C$.  I'm now carefully re-examining each of the given multiple-choice options, particularly the constants, as it seems I was initially off by a factor of 2. I'm verifying the options through differentiation.


**Calculating the Integral**

I've worked through the integral, finding  $\frac{3}{2}(x^2 + 1)^4 + C$.  I've verified my approach using u-substitution, and expanded the original integrand as a sanity check.  It seems none of the given multiple-choice options are actually the correct answer. The answer should be $1.5(x^2 + 1)^4 + C$.


**Examining Question and Solutions**

I've re-reviewed the problem and options, meticulously checking calculations and derivatives. My initial answer of $\frac{3}{2}(x^2 + 1)^4 + C$ is correct, but none of the app's choices match. Option C is closest, but incorrect by a factor of 2. It seems like the question itself might be flawed.


**Concluding the Analysis**

I've meticulously worked through the integral, expanded the integrand, and cross-referenced with the multiple-choice solutions. I'm now confident that my solution is $\frac{3}{2}(x^2 + 1)^4 + C$, which is not one of the app's answers. Option C is close but incorrect. It appears the question has an error.
