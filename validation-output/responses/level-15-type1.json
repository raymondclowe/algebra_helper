The provided correct answer (indicated by the yellow outline) is 37, which is correct.\n- **Distractors:**\n    - **28:** Plausible error (student calculates $7 \\times 4$ but forgets to add 9).\n    - **44:** Plausible error (arithmetic mistake or perhaps calculating $f(5)$).\n    - **41:** Plausible arithmetic error.\n- **Clarity:** The notation is standard and unambiguous.\n- **Difficulty:** Appropriate for a basic algebra/functions drill.",
