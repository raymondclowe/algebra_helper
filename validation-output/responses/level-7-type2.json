    "explanation": "Subtract 7 from both sides: 6x = 54. Then divide both sides by 6: x = 9. Note that inverse operations are performed in reverse order of operations."

    "validationText": "VALID\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Mathematical Correctness:** The equation is $6x + 7 = 61$. Subtracting 7 from both sides gives $6x = 54$. Dividing by 6 gives $x = 9$. The indicated correct answer ($x=9$) is accurate.\n- **Difficulty:** This is a standard two-step linear equation with integer coefficients and an integer solution, perfectly suitable for a \"Level 7\" algebra topic.\n- **Clarity:** The notation is standard and unambiguous.\n- **Distractors:**\n  - $x=10$ (close value, plausible estimation error)\n  - $x=7$ (recurrence of a number in the problem)\n  - $x=-9$ (plausible sign error: $7 - 61 = -54$)\n  These are good distractors.",
