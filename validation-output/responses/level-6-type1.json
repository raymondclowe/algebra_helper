    "validationText": "VALID\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Mathematical Correctness:** The equation $2x = 10$ is correctly solved by dividing both sides by 2, yielding $x = 5$.\n- **Correct Answer:** The option marked as correct ($x=5$) is indeed the correct solution.\n- **Distractors:** The distractors ($x=4, x=6, x=2$) are distinct integers and clearly incorrect, serving as plausible wrong answers for beginners.\n- **Clarity:** The notation is standard and unambiguous.\n- **Level Appropriateness:** Assuming \"Level 6\" corresponds to Grade 6 (IB MYP Year 1), this is an appropriate introductory question for simple linear equations. If \"Level 6\" refers to a difficulty tier within a high school curriculum, it would be considered very easy, but it is mathematically sound.",
