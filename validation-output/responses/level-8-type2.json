    "validationText": "VALID\n\nThe question is mathematically correct and appropriate for the level.\n\n**Analysis:**\n*   **Equation:** $-3x > -15$\n*   **Step 1:** Divide both sides by $-3$.\n*   **Rule:** When dividing an inequality by a negative number, the inequality sign must be reversed.\n*   **Result:** $x < 5$\n\nThe selected correct answer ($x < 5$) is accurate. The distractors are well-chosen to catch common errors:\n*   $x > 5$ catches students who forget to flip the sign.\n*   $x = 5$ catches students treating it as an equality.\n*   $x < -5$ catches arithmetic sign errors.",
