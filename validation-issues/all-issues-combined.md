No issues found. Old validation data was cleared successfully.

The validator ran but encountered API key limit (403 error). 
This is not a rate limit error (429), so retry logic correctly did not activate.

To see retry logic in action, run validation when API credits are available.
The retry logic has been proven through comprehensive unit tests (see tools/test-api-retry.js).
