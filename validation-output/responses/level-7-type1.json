    "explanation": "Subtract 4 from both sides: 4x = 12. Then divide both sides by 4: x = 3. Note that inverse operations are performed in reverse order of operations."

    "validationText": "VALID\n\n**Assessment:**\n- **Mathematical Correctness:** The equation $4x + 4 = 16$ simplifies to $4x = 12$, which yields $x = 3$. The marked correct answer is accurate.\n- **Level Appropriateness:** This is a standard two-step linear equation with integer solutions, perfectly suitable for a Level 7 / middle school algebra topic.\n- **Clarity:** The notation is standard and unambiguous.\n- **Distractors:**\n  - $x=4$ is a plausible distractor (students might ignore the $+4$ and just divide $16$ by $4$).\n  - $x=-3$ checks for sign errors.\n  - $x=7$ is a distinct incorrect value.",
