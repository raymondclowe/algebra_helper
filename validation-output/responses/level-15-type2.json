The highlighted option matches this result.\n\n2.  **Distractors:**\n    *   **6:** This is the value of $g(3)$, catching students who stop halfway.\n    *   **9:** This is the value of $g(f(3))$ ($2(3)=6 \\rightarrow 6+3=9$), catching students who perform the composition in the wrong order.\n    *   **14:** This would be the answer if the input was 4 ($f(g(4)) = 14$), serving as a plausible nearby integer.\n\n3.  **Clarity & Level:**\n    *   The notation is standard and unambiguous.\n    *   The difficulty is appropriate for a basic check on understanding composite functions.\n    *   It is easily solvable within the 30-60 second timeframe.",
