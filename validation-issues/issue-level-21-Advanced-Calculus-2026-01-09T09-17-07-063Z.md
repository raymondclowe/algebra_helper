not OK

The question has a significant flaw: **it contains two correct answers.**

**Explanation:**
1.  **Intended Solution (Implicit Differentiation):**
    Starting with $xy = 1$, differentiating both sides with respect to $x$ gives:
    $$x \frac{dy}{dx} + y = 0$$
    $$\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{y}{x}$$
    This matches the highlighted correct option.

2.  **Alternative Solution (Explicit Differentiation):**
    Starting with $xy = 1$, we can solve for $y$:
    $$y = \frac{1}{x} = x^{-1}$$
    Differentiating with respect to $x$:
    $$\frac{dy}{dx} = -x^{-2} = -\frac{1}{x^2}$$
    This matches the top-left option.

**The Issue:**
Since $y = \frac{1}{x}$, the expression $-\frac{y}{x}$ is mathematically identical to $-\frac{1}{x^2}$.
$$-\frac{y}{x} = -\frac{(1/x)}{x} = -\frac{1}{x^2}$$
Therefore, both the top-left option ($-\frac{1}{x^2}$) and the bottom-left option ($-\frac{y}{x
