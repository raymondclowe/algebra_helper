    "validationText": "VALID\n\n**Analysis:**\n1.  **Mathematical Correctness:** The question asks for the 7th term ($a_7$) of an arithmetic sequence where the first term $a_1 = 3$ and the common difference $d = 5$.\n    *   Formula: $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$\n    *   Calculation: $a_7 = 3 + (7-1)(5) = 3 + 6(5) = 3 + 30 = 33$.\n    *   The indicated correct answer (33) is mathematically accurate.\n\n2.  **Distractors:**\n    *   **38:** Corresponds to calculating $a_1 + n \\cdot d$ (using $n$ instead of $n-1$), which is a common \"off-by-one\" error ($3 + 35 = 38$).\n    *   **28:** Corresponds to the 6th term ($a_6$), another common \"off-by-one\" error.\n    *   **21:** Could result from multiplying $a_1 \\times n$ ($3 \\times 7$), a plausible conceptual error for a beginner.\n\n3.  **Clarity & Notation:** The notation is standard for IB Math ($a_1$, $d$, $a_n$) and the prompt is unambiguous. The difficulty is appropriate for a quick mental math check on sequences.",
