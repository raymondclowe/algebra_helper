The selected option is correct.\n*   **Distractors:** The distractors are well-chosen common mistakes:\n    *   $3(2x+1)^2$: Represents differentiating the outer function but forgetting the inner derivative (forgetting the chain rule).\n    *   $2(2x+1)^2$: Represents a confusion between the inner derivative and the power rule.",
