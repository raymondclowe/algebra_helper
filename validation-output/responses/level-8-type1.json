    "validationText": "VALID\n\n**Assessment:**\nThe question is mathematically correct and free of errors.\n- **Correctness:** Solving $9x < 45$ by dividing both sides by 9 yields $x < 5$. The highlighted answer is correct.\n- **Distractors:** The incorrect options cover common student mistakes:\n  - $x > 5$ (flipping the inequality sign incorrectly).\n  - $x \\leq 5$ (confusing strict inequality with non-strict).\n  - $x = 5$ (treating the inequality as an equation).\n- **Clarity:** The notation is standard and unambiguous.\n- **Level:** For an IB curriculum aligned tool, \"Level 8\" likely corresponds to Grade 8 (MYP Year 3). Solving simple linear inequalities is a standard learning objective for this grade level, making the difficulty appropriate.",
