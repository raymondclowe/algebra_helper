**Assessing the Task's Core**

I'm focused on the task at hand. Initially, I'll dissect the user's math question from the educational app. The question involves finding the integral of 6x cubed, which aligns with integration and series, targeting an IB Math curriculum level 25. Next, I will proceed to solve.


**Confirming the Solution Path**

I've tackled the integration and confirmed the correct result, which is 6x⁴/4 + C or, simplified, 1.5x⁴ + C.  The distractors present common errors, mixing up differentiation and misapplying the power rule. The correct answer, though unsimplified, is present in the options.


**Refining the Evaluation**

I'm now zeroing in on the quality assessment. While the correct answer is mathematically sound, I'm weighing whether the lack of simplification is ideal. The distractors effectively target common integration errors, such as misapplying the power rule or confusing differentiation with integration. My perspective is shifting toward accepting the unsimplified form as valid, given the constraints of the multiple-choice format and educational objectives.


**Revisiting Simplification Concerns**

Now, I'm analyzing the significance of the unsimplified answer in this context. While simplification is ideal in most cases, the distractors effectively target prevalent errors. Seeing the unsimplified form might subtly reinforce the correct application of the power rule, especially given the multiple-choice format. Considering the educational objectives and the absence of a fully simplified option, I lean towards validating the unsimplified response as acceptable.


**Reflecting on the Verdict**

I've been going back and forth, considering if the lack of simplification in the correct answer constitutes a problem. The multiple-choice context, the effective distractors, and the educational level all lean toward accepting the unsimplified form. The question's design appears valid, and given the constraints, my final evaluation is 'OK'.


**Confirming Final Assessment**

I'm now fully confident in the "OK" assessment. The question is valid; it targets integration principles at the expected level. The distractors are designed well and the unsimplified answer, while less than ideal, doesn't detract from the question's validity. Considering the level and the available choices, it's correct and appropriate.


**Reviewing the Verdict**

I'm now fully confident in the assessment. The question presents a standard integration problem, well-aligned with the target curriculum and level. Although simplification could be better, the context of multiple-choice, the presence of effective distractors, and the educational objectives lean toward validating the solution. The answer is valid. I'm satisfied.


**Evaluating the Options and Verdict**

I've been working through the assessment, and now I'm refining the verdict. Considering the context, the curriculum level, and the distractors, I've concluded the unsimplified correct answer is valid. I'm focusing on the educational objectives and the overall validity of the question design. Based on all factors, I am satisfied with the answer.
