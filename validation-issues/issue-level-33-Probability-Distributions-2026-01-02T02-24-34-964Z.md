**ISSUE DETECTED**

There are two main issues with this question:

1.  **Ambiguous Distractors (Major Issue):**
    The question asks, "What is this distribution called?" for $Z \sim N(0, 1)$.
    *   **Option D (Standard normal distribution)** is the *most specific* and intended correct answer.
    *   **Option C (Normal distribution)** is also mathematically correct. The standard normal distribution *is* a normal distribution.
    *   **Option A (Gaussian distribution)** is a synonym for normal distribution, so it is also mathematically correct.
    
    In a multiple-choice format, distractors must be factually incorrect. Here, a student could correctly identify the notation as a "Normal distribution" or "Gaussian distribution" and be marked wrong, despite being factually accurate. This is like showing a picture of a square and having "Rectangle" and "Quadrilateral" as incorrect options alongside "Square".

2.  **Incorrect Topic Categorization (Minor Issue):**
    The top-left corner of the screen displays **"Lvl: 33: Integration & Series"**. However, this is a **Probability / Statistics** question. It is miscategorized in the database.

**Suggested Fixes:**
*   **Fix the Distractors:** Replace the correct-but-broad options with actually incorrect distributions to test the student's ability to distinguish the distribution type, not just the specific sub-type.
    *   *Example Distractors:* "Binomial distribution", "Poisson distribution", "Uniform distribution", "Student's t-distribution".
*   **Alternative Fix (Phrasing):** If the goal is to test the specific vocabulary "Standard Normal", change the question to: *"Which specific term describes the normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1?"* and ensure distractors are not synonyms (e.g., use "General normal distribution" or "Normalized distribution").
*   **Fix Category:** Update the question metadata to belong to the "Probability & Statistics" topic.
