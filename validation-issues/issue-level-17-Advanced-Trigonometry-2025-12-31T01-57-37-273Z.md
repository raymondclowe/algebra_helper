## Gemini 3 Pro Validation Feedback

**VALID**

**Note:**
While the mathematics is perfectly correct, the topic label "**Advanced Trigonometry**" is slightly misleading for this specific question. Converting $45^\circ$ to radians is a foundational skill usually covered in "Introductory Trigonometry" or "Unit Circle Basics". However, as a calibration question (indicated by the "CALIBRATION" tag at the top), checking basic competency is appropriate.
