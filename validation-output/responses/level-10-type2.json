    "explanation": "Find two numbers that multiply to 25 (the constant term) and add to 10 (the coefficient of x). These numbers are 5 and 5: 5 × 5 = 25 and 5 + 5 = 10. Therefore (x+5)(x+5). This can be verified by expanding."

    "validationText": "**Examining the Details**\n\nI'm currently focused on the specific math problem. It involves factorizing the quadratic expression x² + 10x + 25, which should be relatively straightforward. The educational app designates this as a level 10 question, aligning with the IB Math curriculum. I'm noting the topic and instructions to ensure a proper and relevant response.\n\n\n**Reviewing the Solution**\n\nThe solution has been finalized, and I've selected the correct factorization of the quadratic equation. I've gone over the available options, and ensured I am able to justify each one's correctness or incorrectness. I considered whether the level designation seemed appropriate, and while it may be higher than expected, I accepted the level designation.\n\n\n**Considering the App's Level**\n\nI've delved into the question's level in the context of the IB Math curriculum. It's too simplistic for what I'd expect at level 10. While factorizing is appropriate, a perfect square trinomial is usually taught early in secondary education. I'm focusing on why the level designation might be inaccurate, considering the subject's breadth.\n\n\n**Revisiting Difficulty Level**\n\nI'm now focusing on the app's level designation. While the question itself is mathematically sound, its placement at \"Level 10\" feels off, given my understanding of IB Math. I'm considering whether this is a relative difficulty setting within the app's framework or indicative of broader curricular expectations. More analysis is needed to determine the relevance of this.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Assessment**\n\nI've carefully considered the app's question, solving it and analyzing its level within the IB Math context. The math itself is accurate, but the \"Level 10\" designation continues to bother me. Given standard educational expectations, I'm leaning toward the assessment that it's too simplistic for what level 10 typically represents.\n\n\n**Concluding the Analysis**\n\nI've carefully assessed all aspects of the math question, including its solution, distractors, and the level designation. I'm satisfied that the math and its presentation are correct. My concerns remain centered on the level, but I'm hesitant to condemn it, given the ambiguity around the app's grading scale and its possible alignment with a specific grade level. I'll provide feedback on my conclusions.\n\n\n**Assessing the Ambiguity**\n\nI'm now contemplating the ambiguity surrounding the app's level assignment. The question is mathematically sound, but its placement at \"Level 10\" still feels misleading based on standard curricular expectations for IB Math. I'm focusing on the various interpretations of \"Level 10\" to see if I can justify the rating and provide a useful final evaluation.\n\n\n",
