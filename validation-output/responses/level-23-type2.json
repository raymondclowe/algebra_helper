Missing Question / Ambiguity:**\nThe text \"Choosing 2 balls from 9, where 1 is black\" is a sentence fragment describing a scenario. It does not actually ask a question. The student does not know if they are supposed to find:\n- The total number of ways to choose 2 balls (Sample Space).\n- The number of ways to choose the black ball and one other.\n- The probability of choosing the black ball.\n\n**2. Misleading Information:**\nThe phrase \"**where 1 is black**\" is highly confusing given the correct answer.\n- The correct answer, \"Use combinations: $C(9, 2)$\", calculates the **total** number of ways to pick any 2 balls from 9. This calculation ignores the colors of the balls entirely.\n- By mentioning",
