    "validationText": "**Evaluating the Problem's Core**\n\nI'm focused on grasping the essence of the math question, a proof by induction problem seemingly suitable for a user at level 26. I've noted the topic (induction) and the implied background knowledge from the level description. My next step involves deciphering the user's instructions within the problem text, which is cut off.\n\n\n**Confirming the Solution Path**\n\nI've successfully expanded and simplified the provided expression, arriving at the same answer as Option A. I've confirmed that the given math problem requires expansion and simplification of the expression. I have also verified the correct option. The next step is to prepare the answer based on the given context.\n\n\n**Revising and Refining the Answer**\n\nI've examined the answer options critically, identifying option A as the correct expansion and simplification of the expression. While the problem's phrasing might subtly imply substituting  `3m` for `k^3 - k`, the provided options remain in an algebraic form that is acceptable.  I'm ready to craft an explanation to guide the user.\n\n\n**Reflecting on the Educational Context**\n\nI'm now contemplating how the user will interpret the problem. It seems the \"in terms of\" phrasing might lead them to anticipate a final substitution of `3m`, which isn't present in the options. I'll need to clarify this potential confusion in the explanation. The classification of the topic under \"Integration & Series\" is strange, but it is not critical.\n\n\n**Reviewing Problem Characteristics**\n\nI'm now checking the overall educational validity of the question and its presentation. I've confirmed the math is accurate, the answer choices are well-designed to test understanding, and the level is appropriate. I've also identified a minor inconsistency in casing of the variable in the problem's instructions.\n\n\n**Evaluating the Problem's Core**\n\nI'm focused on grasping the essence of the math question, a proof by induction problem seemingly suitable for a user at level 26. I've noted the topic (induction) and the implied background knowledge from the level description. My next step involves deciphering the user's instructions within the problem text, which is cut off.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Clarifying Possible User Confusion**\n\nNow, I'm thinking about the potential for confusion. The user might expect a direct substitution of `3m` based on the context, but the options present an algebraic answer. I'll need to emphasize that the instruction focused on expressing the result \"in terms of\"  `k^3 - k`,  which is accurate. I'm also confirming the question's validity.\n\n\n**Evaluating the Question's Clarity**\n\nI'm focused on potential for confusion due to the phrasing. The instruction to express the result \"in terms of\"  `k^3 - k` is the primary task, and the answer choices are algebraically sound. The seeming incongruity between the \"Assume\" context and the presented options needs highlighting for the user.\n\n\n",
