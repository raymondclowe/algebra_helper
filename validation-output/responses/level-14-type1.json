    "validationText": "VALID\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Mathematical Correctness:** The question asks for the 8th term ($a_8$) of an arithmetic sequence where $a_1 = 3$ and $d = 4$. Using the formula $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$:\n  $$a_8 = 3 + (8-1)(4)$$\n  $$a_8 = 3 + (7)(4)$$\n  $$a_8 = 3 + 28$$\n  $$a_8 = 31$$\n  The indicated correct answer (31) is accurate.\n- **Distractors:**\n  - **35:** Corresponds to the common error of using $n$ instead of $n-1$ in the formula ($3 + 8 \\times 4$).\n  - **27:** Corresponds to finding the 7th term instead of the 8th ($3 + 6 \\times 4$).\n  - **24:** Plausible random distractor or confusion with multiplication ($8 \\times 3$).\n- **Clarity & Notation:** The notation is standard for IB Math and unambiguous. The difficulty is appropriate for a basic check on arithmetic sequences.",
