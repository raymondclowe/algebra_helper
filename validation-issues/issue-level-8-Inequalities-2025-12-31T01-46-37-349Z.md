## Gemini 3 Pro Validation Feedback

This question is **INCORRECT**.

**Issue:**
There is a mismatch between the inequality presented in the question and the provided answer options. The correct mathematical solution is not listed among the choices.

**Detailed Explanation:**
1.  **Solving the displayed question:**
    *   Inequality: $-5x > -12$
    *   Divide both sides by $-5$ (remembering to flip the inequality sign because we are dividing by a negative number).
    *   $x < \frac{-12}{-5}$
    *   **Correct Solution:** $x < 2.4$ (or $x < \frac{12}{5}$)

2.  **Analyzing the "Correct" Option ($x < 3$):**
    *   The option $x < 3$ includes values like $2.5$, $2.6$, etc.
    *   If we test $x = 2.5$ in the original inequality: $-5(2.5) = -12.5$.
    *   $-12.5$ is **not** greater than $-12$. Therefore, $x < 3$ is an incorrect solution set.

**Likely Cause:**
It appears the question generator intended to use numbers that result in an integer solution but failed to do so. It seems the intended question was likely **$-5x > -15$**, which would result in the solution $x < 3$.

**Suggestion to Fix:**
Change the question text to:
**$-5x > -15$**

This will make the solution $x < 3$, matching the currently marked correct option.
