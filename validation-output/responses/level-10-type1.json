    "explanation": "Find two numbers that multiply to 6 (the constant term) and add to 7 (the coefficient of x). These numbers are 1 and 6: 1 × 6 = 6 and 1 + 6 = 7. Therefore (x+1)(x+6). This can be verified by expanding."

    "validationText": "VALID\n\n**Assessment:**\n- **Mathematical Correctness:** The question is mathematically sound. The quadratic expression $x^2 + 7x + 6$ factors correctly to $(x+1)(x+6)$ because $1 \\times 6 = 6$ and $1 + 6 = 7$.\n- **Correct Answer:** The option marked as correct (yellow dashed box) is indeed the correct factorization.\n- **Distractors:**\n  - $(x-1)(x-6)$ tests for sign errors (results in $x^2 - 7x + 6$).\n  - $x(x+7)$ tests for incomplete understanding of factoring trinomials.\n  - $(x+7)(x+6)$ tests for simply grabbing the visible numbers.\n  These are all plausible incorrect answers.\n- **Difficulty:** For a \"Level 10\" (likely corresponding to Grade 10 or an intermediate algebra module), this is an appropriate fundamental question that can be solved quickly.\n- **Formatting:** The LaTeX rendering is clear and standard.",
