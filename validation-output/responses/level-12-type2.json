    "explanation": "By the factor theorem, (x - 3) is a factor of 𝑓(x) if and only if 𝑓(3) = 0. Calculate 𝑓(3) = 3² + 0(3) + -9 = 9 + 0 + -9 = 0. Therefore (x - 3) is a factor."

    "validationText": "**Evaluating the Problem's Core**\n\nI'm currently focusing on the specifics of the math question, examining its components. Polynomials are the key topic, and the grade level suggests it'll be complex. I'm taking a close look at the text and any visual elements. The goal is to fully understand the question and what it's asking.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Solution Path**\n\nI've just finished the mathematical verification. Applying the Factor Theorem confirms that (x-3) is indeed a factor, and the alternative factoring method confirms this again. Considering the context and content, and using the existing prompt, the question seems well-suited for a Grade 8/9 student rather than a Grade 12 student.\n\n\n**Reviewing Question Adequacy**\n\nMy focus has shifted to the context, and I've analyzed if this question suits a Grade 12 student. Given the grade level implies a more advanced curriculum, the question seems far too basic. I'm taking a broader look at the problem. I'm focusing on the mathematical correctness and clarity of the question.\n\n\n**Considering Question Appropriateness**\n\nI'm now assessing the question's suitability for the designated \"Level 12\". While mathematically sound, the content seems far too elementary for advanced math studies, indicating a potential mismatch. The multiple-choice format is adequate, but the focus is on the discrepancy between the question's simplicity and the implied difficulty level.\n\n\n**Reflecting on the Content**\n\nI've examined the question and its components, particularly its appropriateness for a Grade 12 level, and determined its mathematical soundness. The correct answer, \"Yes,\" aligns with the Factor Theorem and factoring techniques. I'm now focusing on the apparent simplicity relative to the assumed grade level.\n\n\n**Finalizing Question Evaluation**\n\nI'm now fully done. I've confirmed mathematical validity, and assessed its suitability, concluding it's a correct question. The difficulty aligns if the question is at a more introductory stage. However, I have recognized a possible disconnect between the question's simplicity and a typical Grade 12 level, noting the potential for review or foundational use.\n\n\n**Final Question Review**\n\nThe mathematical accuracy has been fully confirmed. The question's structure and options are clear. However, while valid, it is simple. The question's difficulty level is suitable if \"Level 12\" is an introductory point within the app, but appears far too basic for a typical Grade 12 curriculum, particularly IB Math.\n\n\n",
