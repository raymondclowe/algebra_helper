    "explanation": "For the quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0, the discriminant Δ = b² - 4ac. Here: Δ = 5² - 4(1)(6) = 25 - 24 = 1. Since Δ > 0, the equation has two distinct real roots."

    "validationText": "VALID\n\n**Analysis:**\n*   **Mathematical Correctness:** The question asks for the discriminant of $x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0$.\n    *   Formula: $\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$\n    *   Values: $a=1, b=5, c=6$\n    *   Calculation: $5^2 - 4(1)(6) = 25 - 24 = 1$.\n    *   The indicated correct answer (1) is accurate.\n*   **Distractors:**\n    *   **25:** Represents calculating only $b^2$.\n    *   **24:** Represents calculating only $4ac$.\n    *   **-19:** Represents calculating $b - 4ac$ ($5 - 24$).\n    *   These are good distractors based on common student errors.\n*   **Clarity & Level:** The wording is unambiguous, and the difficulty is appropriate for an introductory or review question on quadratics within an IB Math context (likely SL or HL Analysis & Approaches/Applications & Interpretations).",
