**ISSUE DETECTED**

**Explanation:**
The question is mathematically incorrect based on the provided answer choices.

1.  **Mathematical Solution:**
    To solve $6x < 27$, you divide both sides by 6.
    $$x < \frac{27}{6}$$
    $$x < 4.5$$

2.  **The Problem:**
    The option marked as correct is **$x < 4$**. This is incorrect because it excludes valid solutions between 4 and 4.5 (e.g., $x = 4.1$ is a valid solution to the original inequality since $6 \times 4.1 = 24.6 < 27$, but it is not included in the answer $x < 4$).

    It appears the generator used integer division (truncating the decimal) or rounded incorrectly.

**Suggested Fix:**
You have two options to fix this:
1.  **Change the Question:** Change the inequality to **$6x < 24$**. This results in the solution $x < 4$, which matches the current correct answer choice.
2.  **Change the Answers:** Update the answer choices to reflect the actual solution, e.g., **$x < 4.5$** or **$x < \frac{9}{2}$**.
