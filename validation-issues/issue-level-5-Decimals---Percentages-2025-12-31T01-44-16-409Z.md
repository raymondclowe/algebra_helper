## Gemini 3 Pro Validation Feedback

The question has **ISSUES**.

**1. Topic Mismatch:**
The topic is listed as **"Decimals & Percentages"**, but the question is a basic integer division problem ($72 \div 9$). There are no decimals or percentages involved in the calculation or the answer. This question does not test the stated topic.

**2. Difficulty Level:**
The question is marked as **Level 5**. In the context of an IB Math curriculum (or generally any secondary education app), a simple multiplication table fact ($72 \div 9$) is elementary level (primary school). It is likely far too easy for a "Level 5" classification.

**Suggested Fixes:**
*   **To fit the topic:** Change the numbers to involve decimals. For example: **$7.2 \div 0.9$** or **$0.72 \div 9$**.
*   **To fit the current question:** Change the topic to "Basic Arithmetic" or "Integers" and significantly lower the difficulty level (e.g., to Level 1).
