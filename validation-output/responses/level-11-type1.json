    "validationText": "The question has **ISSUES**.\n\n**1. Incorrect Topic Classification (Major Issue)**\nThe topic header is labeled **\"Quadratic Equations\"**, but the problem asks to expand $4(x + 2)$.\n*   The result of this expansion is $4x + 8$, which is a **linear expression** (degree 1).\n*   A quadratic equation or expression must contain a squared term (degree 2), such as $x^2$.\n*   This is a fundamental categorization error.\n\n**2. Difficulty Level Mismatch**\nThe level is marked as **11**. In an IB or standard curriculum context, Level/Grade 11 corresponds to students aged 16-17.\n*   Expanding a single bracket by a constant (distributive property) is typically taught in **Grade 7 or 8** (Pre-Algebra).\n*   This question is far too easy for the stated level.\n\n**How to Fix:**\n*   **Option A (Match the Topic):** Change the expression to one that results in a quadratic.\n    *   *Example:* Expand $4x(x + 2)$ $\\rightarrow$ Answer: $4x^2 + 8x$\n    *   *Example:* Expand $(x + 4)(x + 2)$ $\\rightarrow$ Answer: $x^2 + 6x + 8$\n*   **Option B (Match the Content):** Change the topic label to \"Expanding Linear Expressions\" or \"Basic Algebra\" and lower the difficulty rating significantly (e.g., to Level 7 or 8).",
