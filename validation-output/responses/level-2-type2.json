    "validationText": "VALID\n\nThe question is mathematically accurate and appropriate for the stated difficulty level (Level 2: Squares & Roots).\n\n*   **Mathematical Correctness:** The question asks to identify the number which, when squared, equals 9. Since $3^2 = 9$, the answer is correct.\n*   **Clarity:** While technically $(-3)^2$ is also 9, the absence of negative numbers in the options removes ambiguity for this difficulty level.\n*   **Distractors:** The distractors (9, 2, 4) are plausible errors for beginners (e.g., confusing the operation with doubling, or confusing the input/output).",
