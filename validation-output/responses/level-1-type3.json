    "validationText": "VALID\n\n**Assessment:**\n- **Mathematical Accuracy:** The question is mathematically correct. Solving for the missing number: $30 - 4 = 26$.\n- **Correct Answer:** The option marked as correct (26) is indeed the right answer.\n- **Difficulty:** Appropriate for \"Level 1 Basic Arithmetic\". It is a simple one-step linear equation (missing addend).\n- **Distractors:** The distractors are reasonable for this level (e.g., 27 is a close calculation error, 30 and 4 are numbers present in the problem).",
