    "validationText": "This question is **INCORRECT**.\n\n**Issue:**\nThere is a mismatch between the inequality presented in the question and the provided answer options. The correct mathematical solution is not listed among the choices.\n\n**Detailed Explanation:**\n1.  **Solving the displayed question:**\n    *   Inequality: $-5x > -12$\n    *   Divide both sides by $-5$ (remembering to flip the inequality sign because we are dividing by a negative number).\n    *   $x < \\frac{-12}{-5}$\n    *   **Correct Solution:** $x < 2.4$ (or $x < \\frac{12}{5}$)\n\n2.  **Analyzing the \"Correct\" Option ($x < 3$):**\n    *   The option $x < 3$ includes values like $2.5$, $2.6$, etc.\n    *   If we test $x = 2.5$ in the original inequality: $-5(2.5) = -12.5$.\n    *   $-12.5$ is **not** greater than $-12$. Therefore, $x < 3$ is an incorrect solution set.\n\n**Likely Cause:**\nIt appears the question generator intended to use numbers that result in an integer solution but failed to do so. It seems the intended question was likely **$-5x > -15$**, which would result in the solution $x < 3$.\n\n**Suggestion to Fix:**\nChange the question text to:\n**$-5x > -15$**\n\nThis will make the solution $x < 3$, matching the currently marked correct option.",
