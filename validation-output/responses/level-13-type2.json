    "explanation": "To complete the square for x² + 8x: take half the coefficient of x, which is (8)/2 = 4, then square it: 4² = 16. Therefore x² + 8x + 16 = (x + 4)²."

Topic Mismatch (Major Issue):**\n*   **The Problem:** The top-left corner labels the topic as **\"Exponentials & Logarithms\"**. However, the question asks the student to **\"Complete the Square\"** for a quadratic expression ($x^2 + 8x$).\n*   **Why it's wrong:** Completing the square is a fundamental algebraic technique related to quadratic functions and polynomials. It has no direct connection to exponentials or logarithms in this context. A student practicing logs would be confused to see this question.\n\n**2. Difficulty Level Appropriateness (Secondary Issue):**\n*   **The Problem:** The level is marked as **\"13\"**. In an IB curriculum context (where Year 13 is the final year of high school), this question is far too elementary.\n*   **Why it's wrong:** Comple",
