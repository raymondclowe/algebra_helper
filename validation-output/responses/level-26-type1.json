    "explanation": "Add (k+1) to both sides: k(k+1)/2 + (k+1) = (k+1)[k/2 + 1] = (k+1)(k+2)/2. This shows the formula holds for n = k+1."

    "validationText": "**ISSUES FOUND**\n\nWhile the mathematics behind the question is correct, there is a significant formatting error in the question prompt that needs to be fixed.\n\n**1. Formatting/Display Issue:**\n*   **Problem:** The question text at the top is missing spaces between words. It currently reads:\n    *\"Whatis1+2+...+k+(k+1)insimplifiedform?\"*\n*   **Cause:** This usually happens in LaTeX when writing normal text inside a math environment without using `\\text{}` or proper spacing, or simply by omitting spaces in the string generation.\n*   **Fix:** Ensure spaces are included in the string. It should read:\n    *\"What is $1 + 2 + \\cdots + k + (k+1)$ in simplified form?\"*\n\n**2. Mathematical Verification (for confirmation):**\n*   **Logic:** The question asks for the inductive step.\n    $$ \\text{Sum} = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{k} i\\right) + (k+1) $$\n    $$ \\text{Sum} = \\frac{k(k+1)}{2} + (k+1) $$\n    $$ \\text{Sum} = (k+1)\\left(\\frac{k}{2} + 1\\right) $$\n    $$ \\text{Sum} = (k+1)\\left(\\frac{k+2}{2}\\right) = \\frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2} $$\n*   **Correct Answer:** The option marked as correct (top right) is $\\frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}$, which is mathematically accurate.\n*   **Distractors:** The distractors are distinct and incorrect.\n\n**Summary:** The question is mathematically valid, but the **text formatting in the prompt must be corrected** to be legible and professional.",
