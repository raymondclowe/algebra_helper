- 10% one level down
- 5% two levels down
- 3% deeper review

This ensures concepts are reinforced over time, following research-backed learning principles.

### "Why" Questions
Every 3rd question is a conceptual "why" question that asks students to explain reasoning rather than just calculate. This promotes:
- Deeper understanding
- Metacognitive awareness
- Connection between procedures and concepts

### Adaptive Difficulty
The binary search calibration algorithm quickly finds your optimal starting level, ensuring you're working in your Zone of Proximal Development.
