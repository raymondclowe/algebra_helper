## Gemini 3 Pro Validation Feedback

The question has **ISSUES**.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the problems:

1.  **Formatting/Display Error (Critical):**
    The first option is displayed as `0.8999999999999999`. This is a raw floating-point arithmetic error (likely from code calculating $0.6 + 0.3$). It looks unprofessional and confusing.
    *   **Fix:** Ensure the answer generation code rounds values to an appropriate number of decimal places. This option should display simply as **0.9**.

2.  **Category Mismatch:**
    The header in the top-left corner reads **"Integration & Series"**, but the question is clearly about **Probability**.
    *   **Fix:** Update the topic tag to "Probability" or "Statistics".

3.  **Difficulty Alignment:**
    The question is labeled "Level 24" and "Advanced Probability," but it tests the most basic definition of independence ($P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B)$). This is generally considered a fundamental/introductory concept, not advanced.
    *   **Suggestion:** Lower the difficulty level or replace with a question involving conditional probability or Bayes' theorem for this level.

**Correct Mathematical Approach:**
