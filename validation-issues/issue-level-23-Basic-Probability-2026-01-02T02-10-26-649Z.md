## Gemini 3 Pro Validation Feedback

This question has **ISSUES** and requires revision.

**1. Missing Question / Ambiguity:**
The text "Choosing 2 balls from 9, where 1 is black" is a sentence fragment describing a scenario. It does not actually ask a question. The student does not know if they are supposed to find:
- The total number of ways to choose 2 balls (Sample Space).
- The number of ways to choose the black ball and one other.
- The probability of choosing the black ball.

**2. Misleading Information:**
The phrase "**where 1 is black**" is highly confusing given the correct answer.
- The correct answer, "Use combinations: $C(9, 2)$", calculates the **total** number of ways to pick any 2 balls from 9. This calculation ignores the colors of the balls entirely.
