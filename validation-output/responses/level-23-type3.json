    "validationText": "VALID\n\n**Assessment:**\n- **Mathematical Correctness:** The question correctly asks for the complementary probability. Since $P(\\text{success}) + P(\\text{failure}) = 1$, then $P(\\text{failure}) = 1 - \\frac{7}{11} = \\frac{4}{11}$.\n- **Correct Answer:** The option marked as correct ($\\frac{4}{11}$) is accurate.\n- **Distractors:**\n  - $\\frac{7}{11}$ is the original probability (common error).\n  - $\\frac{11}{4}$ is the reciprocal (common error, though impossible as probability $>1$).\n  - $\\frac{11}{12}$ is a random distractor.\n- **Clarity:** The wording is standard and unambiguous.\n- **Difficulty:** Appropriate for \"Basic Probability\".",
