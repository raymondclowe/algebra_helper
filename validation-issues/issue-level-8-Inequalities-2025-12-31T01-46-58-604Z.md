**INCORRECT**

There is a mathematical error in the question setup. The provided "correct" answer does not match the solution to the inequality shown.

**Detailed Explanation:**
1.  **Solving the displayed inequality:**
    $$5x + 10 < 23$$
    Subtract 10 from both sides:
    $$5x < 13$$
    Divide by 5:
    $$x < 2.6$$ (or $x < \frac{13}{5}$)

2.  **The issue:**
    The option marked as correct is **$x < 2$**.
    However, the actual solution is **$x < 2.6$**.
    The statement $x < 2$ is not the correct solution set for the given inequality (it misses values like 2.1, 2.5, etc.).

**Suggested Fix:**
It appears there is a typo in the constant term on the right side of the inequality. To make the answer **$x < 2$** correct, change the number **23** to **20**.

**Revised Question:**
$$5x + 10 < 20$$
*(Solution: $5x < 10 \rightarrow x < 2$)*
