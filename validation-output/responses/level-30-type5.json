    "validationText": "**Examining The Query**\n\nI'm currently reviewing a math question from an educational app. The task is to divide two complex numbers expressed in exponential form, specifically using Euler's form. The expression in question is  $\\frac{7e^{i\\frac{2\\pi}{3}}}{2e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{6}}}$.\n\n\n**Confirming the Answer**\n\nI've confirmed the initial calculation. Dividing the complex numbers, the modulus is 7/4 = 1.75 and the argument is (2π/3 - π/3) = π/3. This clearly matches the corrected option. The distractor answers appear based on common errors: subtracting/adding moduli and adding angles. The question appears consistent with a Level 30 math problem.\n\n\n**Revising Categorization Focus**\n\nI'm now focusing on the category mismatch. The actual math question is about complex numbers in polar form, but the app incorrectly labels it under \"Integration & Series.\" This seems like a categorization error. It suggests the app's database has misclassified this problem, leading to a potential user experience issue where students might be misled about the topic they're practicing. I believe this categorization error needs addressing for this specific question and possibly globally for the relevant levels/areas.\n\n\n**Evaluating The Mislabeling**\n\nI'm now diving into the impact of the mislabeled header. I'm seeing it's more than just a minor bug, it actively misleads the user about the topic being tested, which is a significant issue. The question's math is correct, its difficulty is appropriate for the level, and the distractors are plausible. However, the UI mislabeling poses a serious problem. It needs attention. The internal 'Topic' variable is \"Complex Numbers (Polar)\", which is correct, the UI's \"Integration & Series\" is wrong.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Level Context**\n\nI'm now investigating how the mislabeling affects the level definition. I'm noting the header in the UI defines the level as \"Integration & Series.\" If Level 30 is designed to cover integration and series, a complex number problem shouldn't be there. The app probably needs fixing to avoid misleading users. This feels more than just a minor UI issue. While the core math is solid, the level mismatch is a problem.\n\n\n**Confirming The Prompt's Intent**\n\nI'm now confirming that the prompt's stated topic is the true topic, and not the screenshot header. I've re-examined the prompt text; the \"Topic: Complex Numbers (Polar)\" is the intended subject matter. The screenshot header (\"Integration & Series\") appears to be a UI artifact or testing environment detail. I'm focusing on judging the question's content against the prompt topic, rather than the header. I'm checking the math.\n\nI've checked the math. The final expression matches the correct option. The level of the math checks out to what I would expect for the level it is at.\n\n\n**Verifying The Topic Alignment**\n\nI'm now cross-referencing the level and topic definitions. I'm noting that the prompt specifies Level 30 and \"Complex Numbers (Polar)\", whereas the UI header indicates \"Integration & Series\". I'm thinking the question itself is appropriate for a Level 30 Complex Numbers drill but is misplaced under the current UI's \"Integration & Series\" level, if that's what the UI is meant to signify. I'm focusing on the discrepancy and possible implications.\n\n\n**Addressing a Discrepancy**\n\nI'm now focusing on the conflict between the provided \"Topic: Complex Numbers\" and the screenshot's \"Integration & Series\" header. The primary review criteria don't explicitly require the question to align with the UI header. I'm prioritizing the question's mathematical correctness, which fits the stated Complex Numbers topic. The math, as I see it, is perfect. I'm also considering the mixing of decimals with complex number exponential form.\n\n\n",
