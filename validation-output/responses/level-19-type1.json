    "validationText": "VALID\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Mathematical Correctness:** The calculation is $(4 + 7) + (3i + 1i) = 11 + 4i$. The provided correct answer is accurate.\n- **Difficulty:** This is a basic addition of complex numbers, suitable for an introductory level (Level 19) within a complex numbers unit.\n- **Distractors:** The incorrect options represent common errors (e.g., failing to add the imaginary parts correctly).\n- **Notation:** The notation is clear.\n\n**Minor Suggestion:**\n- While mathematically correct, the term $1i$ is conventionally written simply as $i$. Using $7 + i$ instead of $7 + 1i$ would be more standard, though keeping the $1$ may be helpful for beginners to visualize the addition of coefficients ($3+1$).",
