## Gemini 3 Pro Validation Feedback

The question has **ISSUES**.

**1. Major Topic Mismatch**
*   **Issue:** The topic header in the top-left corner is **"Integration & Series"**, but the question asks to **"FIND THE MEAN"** of a set of numbers.
*   **Explanation:** Finding the mean is a basic **Statistics** concept. It has nothing to do with Calculus (Integration) or Sequences and Series. A student practicing Integration would be confused to see this question.

**2. Difficulty Level Appropriateness**
*   **Issue:** For an IB Math curriculum, finding the mean of four integers is extremely basic (Pre-IB or middle school level).
*   **Context:** If "Level 25" implies a progression where Integration is taught, this question is far too easy and likely misplaced.

**Mathematical Verification (The math itself is correct):**
*   **Sum:** $18 + 24 + 27 + 10 = 79$
*   **Count:** $4$
*   **Mean:** $79 \div 4 = 19.75$
*   The marked correct answer ($19.75$) is accurate.
*   **Distractor Note:** The option $21$ is the *median* of the data set ($10, 18, 24, 27$), making it a plausible distractor for students confusing mean and median.

**How to Fix:**
*   **Option A:** Change the **Topic** label to "Statistics" or "Descriptive Statistics".
*   **Option B (Recommended):**
