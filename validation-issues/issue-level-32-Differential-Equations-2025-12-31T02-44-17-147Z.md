**ISSUES FOUND**

The question is mathematically valid in its prompt, but the set of multiple-choice answers is **flawed** because it contains **two correct answers**.

**Detailed Explanation:**
1.  **Mathematical Derivation:**
    *   The differential equation is $\frac{dy}{dx} = 4y$.
    *   The general solution is $y = Ce^{4x}$.
    *   Applying the initial condition $y(0) = 1$: $1 = Ce^{4(0)} \rightarrow C = 1$.
    *   The particular solution is $y = 1e^{4x}$, which simplifies to **$y = e^{4x}$**.

2.  **The Conflict:**
    *   **Option 3 (Bottom Left):** $y = e^{4x}$
    *   **Option 4 (Bottom Right, marked correct):** $y = 1e^{4x}$
    *   Mathematically, $1 \cdot e^{4x}$ is identical to $e^{4x}$. Therefore, both Option 3 and Option 4 are the correct answer.
    *   In a multiple-choice format, there must be only one unique correct option. A student who selects the simplified form (Option 3) would be mathematically correct but likely penalized by the system.

**Suggestions to Fix:**
*   **Preferred Fix:** Use the standard simplified notation for the correct answer ($y = e^{4x}$) and change the other option to a distinct incorrect distractor (e.g., $y = e^{x+4}$ or $y = \frac{1}{4}e^{4x}$).
*   **Alternative Fix:** If you explicitly want to test the structure $y = Ae^{kx}$ where $A=1$, keep $y = 1e^{4x}$ as the correct answer but change the bottom-left option to something incorrect, such as $y = e^{-4x}$.
