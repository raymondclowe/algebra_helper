    "explanation": "To isolate x, we need to undo the multiplication by 6. We divide both sides by 6 to keep the equation balanced: 6x ÷ 6 = 24 ÷ 6, which gives x = 4."

Assuming \"Level 6\" refers to Grade 6 (MYP Year 1) curriculum where one-step equations are introduced, the difficulty is appropriate.",
