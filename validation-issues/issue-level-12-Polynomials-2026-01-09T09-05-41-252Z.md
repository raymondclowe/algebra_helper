**Evaluating the Problem's Core**

I'm focused on breaking down the math problem. It involves adding linear expressions, a basic polynomial concept. My plan is to simplify the expression by combining like terms, paying close attention to the coefficients and constants. The instruction to "SIMPLIFY" gives the clear direction for my approach.


**Deconstructing the Context**

My initial analysis of the question highlighted the core concepts: adding linear expressions. However, I'm now zeroing in on the "Level 12" designation and its incongruity with the question's simplicity and the stated IB Math curriculum alignment. The difference between grade levels and the difficulty of the problem at each level is very stark. The question seems almost trivially easy for advanced math levels and would be more suitable for the younger groups. I'm considering potential misinterpretations of the "Level 12" notation to reconcile the mismatch, focusing on different contexts where such a label may make sense.


**Investigating the Discrepancy**

I'm now wrestling with the seeming contradiction between the problem's simplicity and the "Level 12" label. My evaluation reveals this to be a significant red flag in the context of IB Math. The math is faultless. The question is a remedial exercise. I'm considering potential explanations for this discrepancy, such as an internal level system that differs from standard grade levels, or a mislabeling on the part of the app. The question's difficulty simply doesn't align with IB-level expectations.


**Scrutinizing the Context**

I'm now focusing on the "IB Math curriculum aligned" aspect. If this question is truly designed to align with an IB math program, the level labeling is clearly misleading. Its elementary nature doesn't reflect the advanced topics associated with the IB curriculum at the upper secondary level, where the standard interpretation of "Level 12" would be applied.


**Examining the Solution's Suitability**

I'm now weighing the question's suitability. The math is faultless, and the distractors appear plausible. My central concern is still the "Level 12" tag. Considering its simplicity relative to the IB Math curriculum, it is most likely a simple mislabeling or a gamified internal level. Either way, this lack of alignment is notable.


**Considering Question's Suitability**

I'm now weighing whether the question aligns with the stated "Level 12." I've reconsidered and realized that if the level refers to age rather than grade, it may be appropriate. But given the "IB Math curriculum aligned" context, I will flag the question for a potential difficulty mismatch, as the problem is too basic for IB standards.


**Assessing the Question's Fit**

I'm now contemplating the impact of the question's level. I've concluded it's mathematically sound, but its elementary nature presents a significant contradiction. The "Level 12" tag is the main issue; it's a poor match. I'm checking the problem's grade relevance.
