**ISSUE DETECTED**

**1. Formatting/Notation Error:**
The primary issue is a display error in the multiple-choice options. All percentage values are displaying a backslash before the percent sign (e.g., `80\%` instead of $80\%$).
*   **Explanation:** In LaTeX code, the percent sign `%` is a special character for comments, so it is written as `\%` to display the symbol. However, the application is displaying the raw source code (the backslash itself) rather than rendering the symbol correctly.
*   **Impact:** This looks unprofessional and could be confusing to students who don't understand code syntax.

**2. Mathematical Content:**
*   **Correctness:** The math itself is correct. Converting the decimal $0.8$ to a percentage yields $80\%$.
*   **Distractors:** The distractors ($8\%$, $0.8\%$, $800\%$) are appropriate common misconceptions.

**Suggested Fix:**
*   **If the text is plain text:** Remove the backslashes from the source data (change `80\%` to `80%`).
*   **If the text is LaTeX:** Check the rendering engine configuration. It is currently treating the backslash as a literal character to be displayed rather than an escape character.
