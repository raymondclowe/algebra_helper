    "validationText": "VALID\n\n**Analysis:**\n1.  **Mathematical Accuracy:** The question asks for the remainder when $f(x) = x^2 + 5x + 4$ is divided by $(x - 2)$. According to the Remainder Theorem, we evaluate $f(2)$.\n    $$f(2) = (2)^2 + 5(2) + 4 = 4 + 10 + 4 = 18$$\n    The calculation is correct.\n2.  **Correct Answer:** The option marked as correct (18) matches the calculated result.\n3.  **Clarity:** The wording is standard and unambiguous.\n4.  **Difficulty:** Appropriate for a basic check of understanding on Polynomials/Remainder Theorem.",
