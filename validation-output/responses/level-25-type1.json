    "validationText": "The question has **ISSUES**.\n\n**1. Major Topic Mismatch**\n*   **Issue:** The topic header in the top-left corner is **\"Integration & Series\"**, but the question asks to **\"FIND THE MEAN\"** of a set of numbers.\n*   **Explanation:** Finding the mean is a basic **Statistics** concept. It has nothing to do with Calculus (Integration) or Sequences and Series. A student practicing Integration would be confused to see this question.\n\n**2. Difficulty Level Appropriateness**\n*   **Issue:** For an IB Math curriculum, finding the mean of four integers is extremely basic (Pre-IB or middle school level).\n*   **Context:** If \"Level 25\" implies a progression where Integration is taught, this question is far too easy and likely misplaced.\n\n**Mathematical Verification (The math itself is correct):**\n*   **Sum:** $18 + 24 + 27 + 10 = 79$\n*   **Count:** $4$\n*   **Mean:** $79 \\div 4 = 19.75$\n*   The marked correct answer ($19.75$) is accurate.\n*   **Distractor Note:** The option $21$ is the *median* of the data set ($10, 18, 24, 27$), making it a plausible distractor for students confusing mean and median.\n\n**How to Fix:**\n*   **Option A:** Change the **Topic** label to \"Statistics\" or \"Descriptive Statistics\".\n*   **Option B (Recommended):**",
