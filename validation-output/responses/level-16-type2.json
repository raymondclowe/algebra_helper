    "validationText": "**Status: HAS ISSUES**\n\nWhile the mathematical calculation and the designated correct answer are accurate, there are significant presentation and categorization errors that need to be fixed.\n\n**Issues Identified:**\n\n1.  **Topic Mismatch (Major Issue):**\n    - The top-left corner labels the topic as **\"Trigonometry Basics\"**.\n    - The question is about a **Geometric Sequence** (Algebra). This is completely unrelated to trigonometry.\n\n2.  **Formatting/Rendering Error:**\n    - The instruction text is displayed as raw code: `\\TEXT{FIND } A_{5}`.\n    - This looks unprofessional and confusing. It should be rendered simply as **\"Find $a_5$\"**.\n\n3.  **Notation Inconsistency:**\n    - The sequence is defined using a lowercase variable ($a_1 = 4$).\n    - The question asks to find an uppercase variable ($A_5$).\n    - In sequence notation, capital letters (like $S_n$ or $A_n$) often represent the *sum* of a series, while lowercase letters represent specific terms. Mixing cases creates ambiguity. It should ask for $a_5$.\n\n**Mathematical Verification (Correct):**\n- Formula: $a_n = a_1 \\cdot r^{(n-1)}$\n- Given: $a_1 = 4$, $r = 3$, find $n=5$.\n- Calculation: $a_5 = 4 \\cdot 3^{(5-1)} = 4 \\cdot 3^4$\n- $3^4 = 81$\n- $4 \\cdot 81 = 324$\n- The marked correct answer (324) is mathematically correct.\n\n**Suggestions for Fix:**\n1.  **Change the Topic Label** to \"Sequences and Series\" or \"Algebra\".\n2.  **Fix the Display Text** to remove the raw LaTeX command. It should read: \"Find the 5th term\" or \"Find $a_5$\".\n3.  **Standardize Notation** to use lowercase $a$ for both the definition and the question (e.g., \"Find $a_5$\").",
