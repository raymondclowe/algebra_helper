    "validationText": "VALID\n\n**Assessment:**\nThe question is mathematically correct, clearly worded, and the answer key is accurate.\n\n*   **Correctness:** $\\sin(30^\\circ) = 0.5$. Since the domain is $0^\\circ \\leq x < 360^\\circ$, the solutions are $30^\\circ$ and $150^\\circ$. The question asks for the \"smallest value\", making $30^\\circ$ the unique correct answer.\n*   **Distractors:** The distractors ($45^\\circ, 60^\\circ, 90^\\circ$) are plausible common errors involving standard unit circle values (e.g., confusing sine and cosine, where $\\cos(60^\\circ) = 0.5$).\n*   **Notation:** The use of degree symbols and interval notation is correct and standard.\n\n**Minor Note on Difficulty:**\nWhile the question is valid, labeling $\\sin(x) = 0.5$ as \"Advanced Trigonometry\" (Level 17) might be slightly misleading depending on the app's scale. In most curricula (including IB), exact values are considered fundamental/introductory trigonometry skills rather than advanced. However, this does not affect the validity of the question itself.",
