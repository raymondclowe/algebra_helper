    "validationText": "The question has **ISSUES** regarding its categorization and difficulty level, although the mathematics itself is correct.\n\n**1. Major Issue: Incorrect Topic Classification**\n*   **The Problem:** The question asks for **Matrix Addition** (Linear Algebra), but the topic is labeled as **\"Advanced Integration\"** in your description and **\"Integration & Series\"** in the screenshot header.\n*   **Why it's wrong:** Matrices and Integration are distinct topics in the IB Math curriculum (and mathematics in general). A student practicing integration would be confused to encounter a matrix algebra problem.\n*   **Fix:** The topic tag must be changed to **\"Matrices\"** or **\"Linear Algebra\"**.\n\n**2. Secondary Issue: Difficulty Level**\n*   **The Problem:** The question is labeled \"Level: 31\" and \"Advanced\".\n*   **Why it'",
