    "explanation": "Use the distributive property: multiply 3 by each term inside the parentheses. 3 × x = 3x, and 3 × 7 = 21. This gives 3x + 21. Common mistake: forgetting to multiply 3 by 7."

    "validationText": "**Assessing the Prompt's Core**\n\nI'm focused on grasping the essence of the user's prompt. My immediate goal is to understand the task: to generate a mathematical problem and tailor a suitable response. The goal is to accurately represent the problem in a way that aligns with the user's expectations. I plan to construct the necessary components for this analysis.\n\n\n**Deciphering Question Components**\n\nI've broken down the user's math question: expanding $3(x+7)$. The correct answer is $3x + 21$. I'm comparing the solution against the other choices, identifying common errors, such as forgetting to multiply each term inside the bracket. I'm also cross-referencing this against the question's stated difficulty level of \"9\" in an attempt to quantify this assessment.\n\n\n**Critiquing the Level Assessment**\n\nI've carefully examined the question's stated difficulty level of \"9.\" After analyzing the curriculum, I'm confident that the question doesn't align with this level. I'm focusing on the implied expectations and the skills a level 9 student would be expected to possess. Based on this, the assigned difficulty appears inflated.\n\n\n**Assessing Question Appropriateness**\n\nI've carefully examined the question's suitability for its stated difficulty level. Considering typical curriculum expectations, this question on expanding expressions is not aligned with the suggested \"Level 9.\" I'm also assessing the quality of the distractors and overall clarity. My conclusion is that the difficulty level is significantly overstated.\n\n\n**Examining Question Suitability**\n\nI've examined the question and its associated parameters, especially the assigned difficulty level. My focus has sharpened on the alignment between the question's complexity and the implied expectations for a \"Level 9\" student. The question, expanding $3(x+7)$, does not adequately challenge these expectations. I am ready to formulate a definitive assessment of the prompt's appropriateness.\n\n\n**Revisiting Difficulty Assessment**\n\nI'm now honing in on the difficulty mismatch. While the math is sound, the \"Level 9\" designation raises concerns. Expanding a basic expression like this aligns more with early algebra concepts than advanced levels. I'm focusing on crafting a response that acknowledges the correctness while highlighting the potentially misleading difficulty level assignment.\n\n\n**Reassessing the Evaluation**\n\nI'm now ready to render a decision. Given the prompt's focus on validity and correctness, and the question's mathematical accuracy, I will mark it as \"VALID.\" However, I must emphasize the discrepancy between the question's inherent simplicity and the assigned \"Level 9,\" which appears inflated when compared to typical curriculum expectations.\n\n\n**Refining Final Evaluation**\n\nI'm now fully committed to delivering a precise response. Given the math is flawless and the distractors are skillfully crafted, I will mark the question as \"VALID\". But, it's crucial to stress the inappropriate difficulty label. This discrepancy, when compared to the standards for IB Math curriculum aligned practice tools, requires a clear note.\n\n\n",
