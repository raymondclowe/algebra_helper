    "explanation": "Use the power rule for differentiation: multiply the coefficient by the exponent, then reduce the exponent by 1. So 5x^3 becomes 5 × 3 × x^2 = 15x^2. The derivative tells us the rate of change of the function."

    "validationText": "VALID\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Question:** Find the derivative of $f(x) = 5x^3$.\n- **Correct Solution:** Using the power rule $\\frac{d}{dx}(ax^n) = anx^{n-1}$, we get $f'(x) = 5 \\cdot 3x^{3-1} = 15x^2$.\n- **Options:**\n  - The marked correct answer ($15x^2$) is mathematically correct.\n  - The distractors represent common student errors:\n    - $15x^3$: Forgetting to decrement the exponent.\n    - $5x^2$: Forgetting to multiply the coefficient by the exponent.\n    - $3x^5$: Swapping the coefficient and exponent.\n- **Presentation:** The notation is standard and clear. The difficulty is appropriate for \"Basic Calculus\".",
