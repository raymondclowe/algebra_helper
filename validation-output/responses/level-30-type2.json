    "validationText": "**Examining the Math Problem**\n\nI've just begun a deep dive into the math question. The task is clear: simplify a complex number expression using De Moivre's Theorem.  The topic focuses on complex numbers, and I'm honing in on the provided expression to formulate a solution strategy.\n\n\n**Evaluating the Solution**\n\nThe solution is now complete. I've successfully applied De Moivre's Theorem. By squaring the modulus and doubling the argument, I've simplified the expression. My next step is to methodically analyze the provided multiple-choice options, checking for any errors in the calculated modulus or argument, identifying the correct answer. I am now proceeding to evaluate the correctness of the multiple choice options provided.\n\n\n**Refining the Critique**\n\nI'm now revisiting the options and focusing on the nuances of simplification. While the numerical calculations are spot-on, the \"simplify\" instruction has become the core issue. I'm carefully considering how the choice of leaving the argument as 2π/6 interacts with the implied level of simplification expected, which feels a little ambiguous given the use of De Moivre's Theorem. The choice of $9e^{i2\\frac{\\pi}{6}}$ seems to favour the theorem application over the final simplification, which is acceptable but unusual.\n\n\n**Reviewing the Analysis**\n\nI'm now revisiting the overall problem. The core of the matter remains: while the computation is flawless, the prompt to \"simplify\" versus the presentation of  $9e^{i2\\frac{\\pi}{6}}$ is a significant area of concern. The solution is correct, but the educational value could be improved by altering the phrasing of the question, or ensuring the answers are as fully simplified as possible. My focus now is how this impacts student learning.\n\n\n**Evaluating the Options Further**\n\nI'm now revisiting the options and the initial \"simplify\" instruction, with a renewed focus on educational design. I see now that the provided answer, $9e^{i2\\frac{\\pi}{6}}$, emphasizes the application of De Moivre's Theorem over complete simplification. This is a subtle nuance. Given the multiple-choice format, the student *must* choose an answer matching the theorem application. I will focus on assessing how this impacts a student's educational experience.\n\n\n**Reflecting on Student Experience**\n\nI am now reviewing the learning experience. The question correctly tests the application of De Moivre's Theorem, but the multiple-choice structure forces students to select an unsimplified answer. This can confuse students, who are used to simplifying fractions, and is thus less helpful. The educational design could be improved.\n\n\n**Reviewing the Feedback**\n\nI'm now revisiting the overall feedback. The math is undeniably correct. The core issue remains in the instructional prompt: 'simplify'. The multiple-choice format, in essence, is testing theorem application over a complete simplification. The feedback should emphasize the inconsistency between the prompt and the provided answer choice, clarifying that full simplification is expected, especially in an IB context. I believe this will help with the next iteration.\n\n\n",
