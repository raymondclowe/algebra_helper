    "validationText": "**Examining the Plane's Parameters**\n\nI've started by extracting the key information. I see a plane defined by its normal vector, and the critical detail that it includes the origin. This suggests I need to think about how this vector dictates the plane's orientation in 3D space, and the implications of the origin's inclusion in defining the plane's position. I'm focusing on the mathematical relationship to proceed.\n\n\n**Formulating the Cartesian Equation**\n\nI've successfully derived the Cartesian equation for the plane: x + 5y + 5z = 0, by applying the standard formula. The plane's normal vector and the fact that it passes through the origin were key. I've now meticulously evaluated the provided options. The correct equation matches my result. I also recognize that the coefficient \"1\" might be included explicitly, even if normally implicit.\n\n\n**Revising the Presentation**\n\nI've examined the problem more closely. I see there's a third, incomplete option presented as a vector column, which I'll set aside since it's not a Cartesian equation. I've re-confirmed that the math is correct, with coefficients matching the normal vector and a zero constant term from the origin. The question's difficulty seems about right for the topic, and the wording is straightforward enough.\n\n\n**Spotting the Discrepancy**\n\nI've flagged a significant issue. The provided text indicates \"Topic: 3D Vectors,\" yet the app screenshot shows \"Lvl: 29: Integration & Series.\" This clash warrants further investigation. I'm focusing on the incongruity between the app's metadata and the problem's actual content. I need to determine if this is an error in the app, or some other aspect.\n\n\n**Addressing Answer Convention**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the presentation of the correct answer. My initial thought was to examine if including the \"1\" as a coefficient, specifically `1x`, is somehow incorrect. I've concluded it's not strictly \"wrong,\" but I can recognize that it deviates from typical mathematical notation, where the coefficient 1 is generally implicit. I will see if that is a key point to note.\n\n\n**Reviewing the Metadata Conflict**\n\nI've examined the presentation of the correct answer, specifically the inclusion of `1x`, and now I see it as slightly unconventional, but acceptable. I'm focusing now on the discrepancy between the \"Integration & Series\" label in the app screenshot, and the 3D vectors topic. The math and question clarity are solid, but this mismatch represents a clear metadata error, which I will flag. I've re-read the prompt requirements, and since it asks if there are any issues, this is a valid one, even if it's not a mathematical error in the question itself.\n\n\n**Checking the Level Appropriateness**\n\nI'm now considering the difficulty level of the question. Level 29 seems relatively high, suggesting this is an intermediate-level problem. Considering the standard math curriculum, particularly for topics like IB Math AA SL/HL, this question about the equation of a plane aligns with the expected content. The \"Integration & Series\" label remains an anomaly, as the material is about planes. I'm satisfied that the math question itself is at an appropriate level.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Problem's Content**\n\nI'm now thinking about the instructions and their implications. I see that I have to determine whether the *question* is valid and if there are any *problems* with it. Now, given that the instructions include a \"Response Format\" that is contingent on whether there are *problems*, the term \"question\" probably refers to the math problem and answer choices. I now need to think about if the level/topic discrepancy represents a \"problem\" with the question, or if it is a separate issue in the app's metadata. I am leaning toward the latter.\n\n\n",
