    "validationText": "**ISSUE FOUND**\n\nThere is a significant **categorization error** in this question.\n\n**1. Topic Mismatch:**\n*   **The Issue:** The header in the top-left corner identifies the topic as **\"Lvl: 16: Trigonometry Basics\"**. However, the question asks for the **\"Sum of arithmetic series\"**, which is an Algebra topic (Sequences and Series), not Trigonometry.\n*   **Why it matters:** A student practicing trigonometry would be confused to encounter a question about arithmetic progressions. It indicates a database tagging error.\n\n**2. Mathematical Verification (The math itself is correct):**\n*   The question asks for the sum of an arithmetic series with $a_1 = 1$, $d = 1$, and $n = 10$.\n*   This is effectively the sum of the first 10 integers: $1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 10$.\n*   Using the formula $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(2a_1 + (n-1)d)$:\n    $$S_{10} = \\frac{10}{2} [2(1) + (10-1)(1)]$$\n    $$S_{10} = 5 [2 + 9]$$\n    $$S_{10} = 5 [11]$$\n    $$S_{10} = 55$$\n*   The provided correct answer (55) is mathematically accurate.\n\n**3. Recommendation:**\n*   **Fix the Category:** Change the topic label from \"Trigonometry Basics\" to **\"Sequences and Series\"** or **\"Arithmetic Progressions\"**.\n*   **Alternatively:** If this level is strictly for Trigonometry, replace the question content with a relevant problem (e.g., \"Calculate $\\sin(30^\\circ)$\" or \"Find the hypotenuse given...\").",
