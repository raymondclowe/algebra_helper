    "explanation": "This is a geometric series with first term a = 1 and common ratio r = 0.25. Since |r| < 1, the series converges. The sum to infinity is S∞ = a/(1-r) = 1/(1-0.25) = 4."

    "validationText": "The question contains a **mathematical error** regarding the correct answer provided.\n\n**Issue:**\nThe marked correct answer is **4**, but the actual mathematical sum of the series is **4/3** (or approx. 1.33).\n\n**Detailed Explanation:**\nThe expression is an infinite geometric series: $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (0.25)^n$\n\n1.  **Identify the components:**\n    *   **First term ($a$):** When $n=0$, $(0.25)^0 = 1$. So, $a = 1$.\n    *   **Common ratio ($r$):** The base of the exponent is $0.25$. So, $r = 0.25$ (or $1/4$).\n\n2.  **Apply the Sum to Infinity formula ($S_{\\infty} = \\frac{a}{1 - r}$):**\n    $$S_{\\infty} = \\frac{1}{1 - 0.25}$$\n    $$S_{\\infty} = \\frac{1}{0.75}$$\n    $$S_{\\infty} = \\frac{1}{3/4}$$\n    $$S_{\\infty} = \\frac{4}{3}$$\n\n**Why the current answer is wrong:**\nIt appears the answer key calculated the reciprocal of the ratio ($1 / 0.25 = 4$) rather than using the correct geometric series formula. Alternatively, the question author might have intended the ratio to be $0.75$ (since $\\frac{1}{1-0.75} = 4$).\n\n**Suggested Fix:**\n*   **Option A (Fix the Answer):** Change the correct answer option from **4** to **4/3** (or **1.33**).\n*   **Option B (Fix the Question):** If the answer must be **4**, change the question to: $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (0.75)^n$",
