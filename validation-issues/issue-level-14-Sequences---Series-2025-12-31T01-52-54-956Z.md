**ISSUES FOUND**

While the mathematics behind the question is correct, there are significant presentation and formatting errors that need to be addressed before this is suitable for students.

**1. Formatting/Rendering Error (Major Issue):**
The instruction at the top of the screen displays raw code: `\TEXT{FIND } A_{8}`.
- It appears the command `\TEXT` is not being recognized by your LaTeX renderer (standard LaTeX uses `\text`).
- Even if it were a valid command, it is not rendering. The student sees code syntax instead of a clean question prompt.
- **Fix:** Change the source text to standard text or ensure the LaTeX renders properly. It should simply read: **"Find $a_8$"**.

**2. Notation Inconsistency:**
- The sequence is defined using a lowercase variable: $a_1 = 4$.
- The question asks to find an uppercase variable: $A_8$ (inside the curly braces of the unrendered code).
- In mathematics, $a$ and $A$ are distinct variables.
- **Fix:** Ensure consistency. If the given term is $a_1$, the question should ask for $a_8$.

**Mathematical Verification (for reference):**
- **Formula:** $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$
- **Calculation:** $a_8 = 4 + (8-1)(5) = 4 + 7(5) = 4 + 35 = 39$
- **Correct Answer:** 39 (The option marked as correct is valid).
- **Distractors:**
   - 44: Common error using $n$ instead of $n-1$ ($4 + 8 \times 5$). Good distractor.
   - 34: Calculation error or finding $a_7$. Good distractor.

**Summary of Action Items:**
1.  Fix the rendering bug for the "Find..." text.
2.  Change $A_8$ to $a_8$ to match the variable case used in the sequence definition.
