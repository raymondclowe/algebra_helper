    "validationText": "not OK\n\n**Issue:**\nThe question is impossible to answer because the data visualization (the boxplot chart) is not rendering in the screenshot. Instead of the chart, there are empty LaTeX display math delimiters (`\\[` and `\\]`) shown in the center of the screen. The student has no information about Group A or Group B to calculate the IQR.\n\n**Detailed Explanation:**\n1.  **Rendering Error:** The screenshot shows `\\[` and `\\]` with a large empty space between them. This suggests that the HTML code for the chart (provided in the prompt text) was accidentally wrapped in LaTeX math delimiters. Since HTML `<canvas>` elements cannot be rendered inside LaTeX math mode, the chart fails to appear.\n2.  **Missing Context:** The question asks \"Which group has the greater spread (IQR)?\", but without the visual boxplots, the values for Q1 and Q3 are unknown to the user.\n\n**Correction Required:**\n1.  **Remove LaTeX Tags:** Remove the `\\[` and `\\]` delimiters surrounding the chart code in the question source. The HTML/JavaScript for the chart should stand alone to render properly.\n2.  **Verify Rendering:** Ensure the Chart.js visualization appears visible to the user, showing the two boxplots side-by-side.\n\n**Mathematical Verification (based on the provided code snippet):**\nOnce the chart is visible, the math is correct:\n- **Group A:** $Q1 = 15$, $Q3 = 25$. $IQR = 25 - 15 = 10$.\n- **Group B:** $Q1 = 30$, $Q3 = 50$. $IQR = 50 - 30 = 20$.\n- **Comparison:** $20 > 10$, so **Group B** has the greater spread.\n- The marked correct answer (Group B) is mathematically correct based on the hidden data.",
