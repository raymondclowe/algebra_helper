    "validationText": "**ISSUE FOUND**\n\nThere is a significant mismatch between the stated **Topic** and the **Question Content**.\n\n**Explanation:**\n1.  **Topic Mismatch:** The topic is labeled as **\"Multiplication & Division\"** (visible in the top-left corner and the prompt), but the problem presented is **$? + 14 = 20$**. This is an **addition/subtraction** problem (finding a missing addend). It does not test multiplication or division skills.\n2.  **Pedagogical Confusion:** A student selecting a \"Multiplication & Division\" module expects to practice factors, products, or quotients. Encountering a basic addition problem breaks the learning flow and does not assess the intended skill.\n\n**How to Fix:**\n*   **Option A (Change Question):** Replace the equation with one that fits the topic.\n    *   *Example:* $? \\times 4 = 20$ (Answer: 5)\n    *   *Example:* $14 \\div ? = 2$ (Answer: 7)\n*   **Option B (Change Topic):** If the intention is to test this specific equation, change the Topic label to **\"Addition & Subtraction\"** or **\"Pre-Algebra\"**.",
