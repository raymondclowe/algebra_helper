    "validationText": "**Examining the Query**\n\nI'm currently reviewing a math question from an educational app. The problem appears to involve 3D vectors and specifically focuses on the normal vector of a plane. Intriguingly, the app indicates the question is at level 29, but it's listed within Integration & Series, a curious discrepancy I'll need to investigate further.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Solution**\n\nThe normal vector is straightforwardly derived from the equation's coefficients, confirming the initial assessment. Further, I can see the app's highlighted answer directly matches my calculation, validating the solution. Now, I will begin to address the potential level/topic discrepancy.\n\n\n**Verifying the Options**\n\nI'm now carefully examining the multiple-choice options. I've confirmed that the top-left option, which matches my calculation, is a valid normal vector. I've also realized that the top-right option, the negative of the calculated normal vector, is mathematically correct. This highlights a potential ambiguity in the question's wording (\"the\" normal vector). The other two options are incorrect, likely distractors, as they improperly utilize the constant term. This indicates a potential design flaw in the question.\n\n\n**Addressing the Ambiguity**\n\nI'm now grappling with the implications of the second answer choice. The negative of the calculated normal vector is mathematically correct, which creates an unforeseen ambiguity. This is a subtle yet significant detail for a level 29 question, potentially leading to confusion. Furthermore, I have already ruled out the bottom two choices, as they improperly utilize the constant term.\n\n\n**Re-evaluating the Question**\n\nI'm now reconsidering the question's suitability. While technically correct, the presence of the negative normal vector creates ambiguity, which could confuse students. This is especially concerning, as the app indicates it's at level 29, which leads me to believe a certain level of precision is expected.\n\n\n**Revising the Recommendation**\n\nI'm now refining the recommendations based on the identified issues. The main problem is the potential for ambiguity due to the negative normal vector, creating confusion for the student. Moreover, the mismatch between the level/topic tag needs to be addressed during question tagging and the question itself.\n\n\n**Refining the Response**\n\nI'm now formulating a detailed response for the user, clearly outlining the errors. I plan to state the question is \"not OK\" due to the ambiguous second option. Then, I will mention how the negative normal vector is technically correct. Furthermore, I will suggest that the second answer be replaced with an incorrect, yet obviously wrong, value to avoid ambiguity. Finally, I will address the level/topic mismatch in the app.\n\n\n**Evaluating the Errors**\n\nI've determined the question isn't suitable, primarily because the negative normal vector is also correct, causing ambiguity. The app's design choice creates the possibility of penalizing mathematically correct reasoning. I plan to recommend a switch to a more obviously incorrect distractor.\n\n\n",
