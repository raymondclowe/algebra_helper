    "explanation": "We need two numbers that multiply to 12 (the constant term) and add to 8 (the coefficient of x). These numbers are 2 and 6 because 2 × 6 = 12 and 2 + 6 = 8. So the answer is (x+2)(x+6). Check by expanding: you should get back to the original expression."

    "success": true,
    "validationText": "VALID\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Mathematical Correctness:** The factorization is correct. We need two numbers that multiply to 12 and add to 8. Those numbers are 2 and 6. Therefore, $(x+2)(x+6)$ is the correct solution.\n- **Distractors:**\n  - $(x-2)(x-6)$ tests for sign errors.\n  - $x(x+8)$ tests for incomplete understanding (ignoring the constant).\n  - $(x+8)(x+12)$ tests for simply plugging in the visible numbers.\n- **Difficulty:** Appropriate for a Grade 10 (Level 10) student learning quadratic factorization.\n- **Clarity:** The notation and instructions are standard and unambiguous.",
